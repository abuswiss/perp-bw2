          "syllabus": "The Defendant, Michael Rimmer, was convicted by a Shelby County jury of first degree premeditated murder, first degree felony murder, and aggravated robbery. T.C.A. §39-13-202(1), (2) (Supp. 1998) (first degree murder), §39-13-402 (1997) (aggravated robbery). The trial court merged the felony murder conviction into the premeditated murder conviction. The jury sentenced the Defendant to death for the first degree murder conviction, and the trial court sentenced him to eighteen years for the aggravated robbery conviction and ordered it to be served consecutively to the sentence for the murder conviction. On appeal, the Defendant contends that: (1) the evidence is insufficient to support his convictions for first degree murder and aggravated robbery (2) the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the felony murder charge (3) the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress DNA evidence (4) the trial court erred in not striking the State's opening statement or declaring a mistrial based on a comment made by the State (5) the trial court erred in admitting evidence of the Defendant's prior convictions (6) the trial court erred in limiting the testimony of William Baldwin (7) the trial court erred in admitting a drawing of the backseat of the Honda the Defendant was driving when he was arrested (8) the trial court erred in finding James Allard was unavailable and allowing his testimony from the previous trial to be entered into evidence (9) the trial court erred in admitting hearsay testimony through witness Rhonda Bell (10) the trial court erred in allowing Chris Ellsworth to display his scars to the jury (11) the trial court erred in allowing hearsay testimony through witness Tim Helldorfer (12) the trial court erred in limiting the testimony of Tim Helldorfer regarding a photograph identification and the release of the Honda from police custody (13) the trial court erred in allowing Joyce Carmichael to testify about Tommy Voyles (14) the trial court erred in admitting previous testimony of deceased or otherwise unavailable witnesses (15) the trial court erred in admitting Richard Rimmer's prior statement and related exhibits as substantive evidence (16) the trial court erred in limiting the testimony of Kenneth Falk (17) the trial court erred in limiting the testimony of Marilyn Miller (18) the trial court erred in excluding documents relating to a lawsuit involving the Shelby County Jail and (19) the trial court erred in applying an aggravating factor and imposing a consecutive sentence for the aggravated robbery conviction. Following our review, we affirm the judgments of the trial court."

ERICKSON,\n\n       DEFENDANT-APPELLANT-CROSS-RESPONDENT.\n\n\n\n\n                    APPEAL and CROSS-APPEAL from a judgment of the circuit court\nfor Dane County: JOHN D. HYLAND, Judge. Affirmed.\n\n         ¶1         BLANCHARD, J.1 Erick Erickson appeals a judgment of the\ncircuit court following a bench trial at which the court found Erickson guilty of\n\n\n         1\n          This appeal is decided by one judge pursuant to WIS. STAT. § 752.31(2)(c) (2023-24).\nAll references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2023-24 version.\n\f                                                                                    No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\noperating with a prohibited alcohol concentration, as a first offense, and separately\nfound that Erickson had unreasonably refused to submit to a chemical test of his\nbreath following his arrest. Erickson challenges the court’s denial of his motion to\nsuppress evidence. Erickson argues that there was not sufficient evidence to\njustify a request by police that he submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT) before\nhis arrest. Erickson also contends that there was not sufficient evidence to support\nprobable cause to arrest him. I reject these arguments and accordingly affirm.2\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n        ¶2      City of Monona police cited Erickson with operating a motor vehicle\nwhile intoxicated in violation of WIS. STAT. § 346.63(1)(a) and operating with\nprohibited alcohol concentration in violation of § 346.63(1)(b). The police also\ngave Erickson a notice of intent to revoke his operating privileges for allegedly\nrefusing to submit to a chemical test of his breath after his arrest under\nWisconsin’s implied consent law. See WIS. STAT. § 343.305.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n            The City of Monona cross appeals, but I need not address the cross appeal. Explaining\nfurther, the City challenges the circuit court’s determination that Erickson was not guilty of\noperating under the influence of an intoxicant on the ground that there is “no evidence in the\nrecord to support a not guilty verdict.” The City states that its cross appeal is “protective,” by\nwhich it means that the cross appeal is intended to preserve an argument that, if Erickson is\nsuccessful in his appeal of the prohibited alcohol concentration conviction, the City should be\nallowed to pursue a judgment against Erickson for operating under the influence of an intoxicant\nand a corresponding sentence. See State v. McAdory, 2024 WI App 29, ¶32, 412 Wis. 2d 112, 8\nN.W.3d 101, review granted, 2024 WI 40, 414 Wis. 2d 187, 15 N.W.3d 24 (discussing\nmunicipality’s failure to file protective cross appeal in Town of Menasha v. Bastian, 178 Wis. 2d\n191, 196, 503 N.W.2d 382 (Ct. App. 1993)); Savich v. Columbia Cnty.

Because I reject Erickson’s challenge to the prohibited alcohol concentration\ncitation, there is no need to reach the City’s cross appeal. See Dickman v. Vollmer, 2007 WI App\n141, ¶3, 303 Wis. 2d 241, 736 N.W.2d 202.\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f                                                                          No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶3     Erickson was found guilty of both offenses in municipal court.\nThere is no dispute that Erickson timely demanded a hearing on the refusal\nallegation. He appealed for a trial de novo in the circuit court.\n\n       ¶4     In circuit court, Erickson filed a motion to suppress evidence\nobtained as a result of what he alleged was an unlawful request that he undergo a\nPBT. In the alternative, he moved to suppress evidence later obtained following\nhis arrest on the ground that the arrest was unlawful.\n\n       ¶5     The circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on Erickson’s motion.\nIt was established that Erickson entered a retail store on the night of January 28,\n2020, and asked to borrow or purchase a shovel to dig his car out of some sort of\nsnow accumulation in a nearby parking lot. Store employees did not give him a\nshovel. A manager of the store testified that, based on observations of Erickson\nduring this encounter, the manager believed that Erickson was drunk, and the\nmanager called the police to report suspicion of an intoxicated driver.\n\n       ¶6     The two officers who were dispatched in response, Jared Wedig and\nLandon Flora, testified in pertinent part as follows. Wedig and Flora went to a\nparking lot near the store, where the officers encountered Erickson, who was by\nhimself. Erickson was attempting to use an umbrella to dig a car out of several\ninches of snow that had accumulated on that portion of the lot.\n\n       ¶7     Both officers smelled the odor of alcohol on Erickson’s breath,\nnoticed that his speech was slurred, and observed that Erickson had parked his car\nin an unplowed portion of the parking lot, which was well-lit, despite the fact that\na significant portion of the parking lot had been plowed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n        ¶8      The officers requested that Erickson undergo a PBT.                     Erickson\ninitially consented to do this, but he did not provide a breath sample sufficient to\ncreate a meaningful result. The officers continued to talk with Erickson for a time,\nand then placed him in handcuffs and moved him to the front of one of the\nofficers’ squad cars. This was because, according to Wedig, Erickson was “trying\n[to] play games or at least prolong the process” of determining whether Erickson\nwas impaired for purposes of operating a motor vehicle. The officers requested\nthat Erickson take the PBT again, but he declined. The officers then requested that\nErickson undergo field sobriety tests, which he also declined.\n\n        ¶9      Officers Wedig and Flora both recorded their interactions with\nErickson on body cameras. Portions of these recordings were played during the\nhearing and are preserved in the record on appeal.\n\n        ¶10     On July 26, 2023, the circuit court issued a written decision denying\nErickson’s motion. As part of its analysis, the court fully credited the testimony of\nthe store manager and the officers.\n\n        ¶11     The circuit court held a bench trial on the citations, which also\nserved as the refusal hearing.3 The store manager and the two police officers again\ntestified, with Officer Flora’s testimony now additionally covering events after\nErickson’s arrest. This included testimony that Flora read to Erickson from an\n“informing the accused” form, that Erickson refused to submit to a chemical test\nof his breath, and that Flora then obtained a warrant to test Erickson’s blood. A\nphlebotomist testified regarding a blood sample that she took from Erickson after\n\n        3\n          Erickson moved for a jury trial, which the circuit court denied in a ruling that Erickson\ndoes not challenge on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nhe was transported by police to an area hospital. Further, an employee of the state\ncrime laboratory testified regarding the testing of the blood sample, which\nreflected a blood alcohol concentration of .092 grams per 100 milliliters.\n\n       ¶12    The circuit court found Erickson not guilty of operating while under\nthe influence and guilty of operating with a prohibited alcohol concentration. The\ncourt further found that Erickson had refused, after his arrest, to submit to the\nrequested chemical test of his breath and that it was unreasonable for him to do so.\n\n       ¶13    Erickson appeals.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\n       ¶14    As noted, Erickson argues that the officers lacked the necessary level\nof probable cause to request that he undergo a PBT, and he further argues in the\nalternative that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him. I apply the\nfollowing standards of review to both issues.\n\n       ¶15    This court will “uphold the trial court’s findings of fact unless they\nare clearly erroneous.    Whether those facts satisfy the statutory standard of\nprobable cause is a question of law we review de novo.” County of Jefferson v.\nRenz, 231 Wis. 2d 293, 316, 603 N.W.2d 541 (1999) (citations omitted)\n(concluding that investigating officer had probable cause to request a PBT).\n\n       I. Request for PBT\n\n       ¶16    Erickson argues that the City failed to show that the officers had\n“probable cause to believe” that Erickson was operating under the influence or had\na prohibited alcohol concentration, which by statute was required before they\ncould lawfully request that he submit to a PBT. See WIS. STAT. § 343.303; State\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                                                                       No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nv. Felton, 2012 WI App 114, ¶¶7-8, 344 Wis. 2d 483, 824 N.W.2d 871. “Probable\ncause to believe” is a quantum of proof that is “‘greater than the reasonable\nsuspicion necessary to justify an investigative stop … but less than the level of\nproof required to establish probable cause for arrest.’” See Felton, 344 Wis. 2d\n483, ¶8 (quoting Renz, 231 Wis. 2d at 316).           Although it is unclear from\nErickson’s briefing, I understand his argument to be that the officers violated\n§ 343.303 from the moment that they first requested that Erickson submit to a PBT\nbecause they lacked the requisite level of probable cause. I conclude that, when\nthe officers requested that Erickson submit to a PBT, the information that was\nobjectively available to the officers exceeded the amount of evidence necessary to\njustify that request.\n\n       ¶17     The following facts support probable cause to believe that Erickson\ncommitted a drunk driving offense at the time the officers requested that he submit\nto a PBT. No one piece of evidence was especially strong or dispositive, but\ntogether they easily meet the legal standard. See State v. Post, 2007 WI 60, ¶¶36-\n38, 301 Wis. 2d 1, 733 N.W.2d 634 (weaving within a lane constituted “poor\ndriving” that, accumulated with other relevant facts, supported conclusion that\nofficer had reasonable suspicion of drunk driving).\n\n       ¶18     Unusual conduct regarding snow bank. There is no dispute that\nErickson appeared to have driven his car onto an unplowed area of the parking lot,\nmaking it necessary for him to dig it out.      This was despite the fact that a\nsubstantial portion of the well-lit lot had been plowed. Then, he was found trying\nto dig out the car with an umbrella. All of these facts could reasonably have been\nviewed as possible indications of impaired judgment due to the effects of\noverconsumption of alcohol.\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f                                                                         No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶19    Smell of alcohol. The circuit court credited the testimony of both\nofficers, not just one, that they both smelled the odor of alcohol on Erickson’s\nbreath. See State v. Kennedy, 2014 WI 132, ¶¶22-23, 359 Wis. 2d 454, 856\nN.W.2d 834 (“an odor of intoxicants” among the facts that can support a finding\nof probable cause to arrest for a drunk-driving-related crime). Without providing\na citation to the record, Erickson refers to the smell of intoxicants on his breath\nreported by the officers as having been only a “light” smell. But the store manager\nand officers did not qualify the smell of intoxicants on Erickson’s breath as\n“light.” In fact, Officer Wedig testified that the odor was “[f]airly strong,” even\nwhen Erickson was standing outdoors in cold weather, an environment in which\nodor typically dissipates more readily than in a vehicle or a room of a structure.\n\n       ¶20    Slurred speech. Both officers testified that Erickson’s speech was\nslurred.   The circuit court found that Erickson’s speech featured “a mix of\nshortness of breath and slurring.” See id. (slurred speech among the relevant facts\nthat can support finding of probable cause to arrest for a drunk-driving-related\ncrime). At the same time, the court credited the testimony of the officers that\nErickson’s speech was not consistently slurred, only sometimes. This is also\nconsistent with Officer Wedig’s testimony that Erickson’s speech was generally\nnot difficult to understand.    But slurring of speech is one reasonably strong\nindication of potential impairment, and experience teaches that slurred speech by\nsome persons under some circumstances is not difficult to comprehend.\n\n       ¶21    Responses to questions. The circuit court found that, when Officer\nFlora asked Erickson if he had been drinking, Erickson “appeared to be evading\ngiving a direct response.”     For example, in Flora’s body camera recording,\nErickson can be heard denying that he had had anything to drink, despite the odor\nof alcohol on his breath. This counts toward meeting the probable-cause-to-\n\n                                          7\n\f                                                                         No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nbelieve standard. See State v. Babbitt, 188 Wis. 2d 349, 357, 525 N.W.2d 102 (Ct.\nApp. 1994) (fact that driver of stopped vehicle “consistently displayed an\nuncooperative attitude and reluctantly complied with the officers’ various\nrequests” contributed to conclusion that driver was probably driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol).\n\n       ¶22    Considered together, these facts were more than sufficient to justify\na request that Erickson submit to a PBT under WIS. STAT. § 343.303. That is,\nconsidering them “in the aggregate,” see State v. Hogan, 2015 WI 76, ¶37, 364\nWis. 2d 167, 868 N.W.2d 124, I conclude that any reasonable officer in the\nposition of these officers would reasonably suspect that Erickson had operated\nwith a prohibited alcohol concentration.\n\n       ¶23    Erickson argues that the circuit court erred in finding that his speech\nwas slurred and, when that finding is ignored, the cumulative evidence does not\nrise to the requisite level of probable cause. In support, Erickson contends that the\naudio from the officers’ body camera recordings provides objective evidence that\nErickson did not slur his words—rather, he was at times difficult to understand\nonly because he was out of breath from attempting to dig his car out of the snow\nusing an umbrella.\n\n       ¶24    Based on my own review of the recordings from both officers, I\ncannot conclude that it is unreasonable to interpret Erickson’s speech as both\nbeing affected by his being out of breath and also slurred at times. There may be\nother reasonable interpretations of Erickson’s speech, but this does not establish\nclear error. See State v. Sykes, 2005 WI 48, ¶21 n.7, 279 Wis. 2d 742, 695\nN.W.2d 277 (a factual finding is clearly erroneous if “‘it is against the great\nweight and clear preponderance of the evidence’” (quoted source omitted)).\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                                                                         No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nErickson faults the testimony of the officers, and the circuit court’s findings of\nfact, because specific slurred words were not identified.        But this does not\nestablish clear error in finding that Erickson slurred some words. In a similar vein,\nErickson emphasizes that, when cross examined about Erickson’s slurred speech,\nthe officers declined to characterize the slurring as “moderate[] or heav[y].” For\nexample, Officer Wedig testified that Erickson’s speech “was slurred. I don’t put\na level on it as far as moderate or not.” But Erickson does not explain why the\ncourt was obligated to discount the officers’ testimony regarding slurring merely\nbecause they did not characterize the degree of slurring.\n\n       ¶25    Still on the slurred speech topic, Erickson contends that the circuit\ncourt should not have credited the testimony of the officers in part because the\nofficers were unfamiliar with Erickson’s normal manner of talking. Erickson\nquestions how the officers could have determined that what sounded to the officers\nlike slurred words might not in fact have been attributable to Erickson’s normal\nspeech patterns, given that some people in their everyday speech slur their words\nmore than other people and that Erickson was a stranger to the officers. However,\nthis argument fails because police officers are not required to rule out innocent\ninferences when assessing whether there is probable cause to believe that a drunk-\ndriving-related offense has occurred. See State v. Nieves, 2007 WI App 189, ¶14,\n304 Wis. 2d 182, 738 N.W.2d 125 (“an officer is not required to draw a reasonable\ninference that favors innocence when there also is a reasonable inference that\nfavors probable cause”). Inebriation can cause slurred speech, even if slurred\nspeech can also arise from other causes.\n\n       ¶26    Erickson argues that the circuit court should have generally found\nthe officers to be not credible based on various statements that the officers made to\nErickson, but Erickson fails to show any credibility issue that could have arisen\n\n                                           9\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nfrom the statements that he highlights, much less an issue that undermines the\ncourt’s relevant findings. See State v. Hughes, 2000 WI 24, ¶2 n.1, 233 Wis. 2d\n280, 607 N.W.2d 621 (circuit court is the “‘ultimate arbiter of the credibility of a\nwitness’” and this court will uphold the circuit court’s “determination of\ncredibility unless that determination goes against the great weight and clear\npreponderance of the evidence” (quoted source omitted)). Erickson notes that\nOfficer Flora told Erickson that, if the officers determined that Erickson had “been\ndrinking,” then the officers were not going to allow him to “drive away,” and also\nnotes that later both officers told Erickson that, if the PBT reflected that he was\nbelow the legal limit, they would allow him to drive away. These statements can\nbe easily reconciled. In the first statement, the reference to “drinking” could\nreasonably be interpreted to mean consuming enough alcohol to put Erickson over\nthe legal limit, and consistent with that, a favorable PBT reading would put him in\nthe clear.4\n\n        ¶27     Erickson accurately observes that the officers here did not observe\nhim to have bloodshot or glassy eyes, nor did the officers observe him to display\n\n\n\n\n        4\n           For the first time in his reply brief on appeal, Erickson makes another argument based\non the officers’ statements about the possibility of Erickson avoiding detention, characterizing the\nofficers’ statements as a “ploy” or a “ruse.” The first problem with this argument is that it comes\ntoo late. See A.O. Smith Corp. v. Allstate Ins. Cos., 222 Wis. 2d 475, 492, 588 N.W.2d 285 (Ct.\nApp. 1998) (appellate courts generally do not consider arguments raised for the first time in an\nappellant’s reply brief for reasons of fundamental fairness). Further, the argument is not well\ndeveloped or supported. For example, Erickson fails to develop an argument that the circuit court\ncould not reach a contrary interpretation of the officers’ words and actions or an argument that,\nbased on these statements, the court was required to disregard other relevant aspects of the\nofficers’ testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f                                                                                No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\ndifficulty with his balance. But this additional evidence was not necessary to\nestablish the requisite level of probable cause.5\n\n        II. Probable Cause to Arrest\n\n        ¶28    Erickson argues that the circuit court should have suppressed\nevidence that police obtained after the moment when, in his view, he was arrested.\nSpecifically, he contends that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him\nwhen they placed him in handcuffs, at which time one of the officers told Erickson\nthat it was “too late” to provide a PBT. For purposes of this appeal, the City\nassumes that Erickson was arrested when the officers placed him in handcuffs, and\nI follow in that assumption. Taking that as the moment of arrest, I conclude that\nthe City has shown that the officers had probable cause to arrest Erickson at that\ntime.\n\n        ¶29    Our supreme court has explained the probable cause standard in this\ncontext as follows:\n\n               Probable cause to arrest for operating while under the\n               influence of an intoxicant refers to that quantum of\n               evidence within the arresting officer’s knowledge at the\n               time of the arrest that would lead a reasonable law\n               enforcement officer to believe that the defendant was\n               operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an\n               intoxicant. The burden is on the state to show that the\n               officer had probable cause to arrest\n\n                      The question of probable cause must be assessed on\n               a case-by-case basis, looking at the totality of the\n               circumstances. Probable cause is a “flexible, common-\n\n        5\n         Because I conclude that Officer Flora had probable cause to believe that Erickson had\ncommitted a drunk driving offense justifying the PBT request, I do not address the City’s\narguments that Erickson “waived” his challenge to the PBT request and that the appropriate\nremedy for an improper PBT request in this case is not suppression.\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n                sense measure of the plausibility of particular conclusions\n                about human behavior.” …. In determining whether there\n                is probable cause, the court applies an objective standard,\n                considering the information available to the officer and the\n                officer’s training and experience.\n\nState v. Lange, 2009 WI 49, ¶¶19-20, 317 Wis. 2d 383, 766 N.W.2d 551\n(footnotes, containing citations, omitted).\n\n        ¶30     The following is additional relevant background reflected on Officer\nFlora’s body camera recording.\n\n        ¶31     Officer Flora asked Erickson to submit to a PBT, and Erickson\nappeared to consent. But then Erickson walked around his car to the driver’s door,\nopened it, and sat down in the driver’s seat. After handing Officer Flora his\ndriver’s license, Erickson reached for a large, clear plastic bottle that appeared to\ncontain water. As Erickson uncapped the bottle, Officer Flora instructed him not\nto drink from it.6 Erickson responded that he was thirsty and took a drink lasting\nseveral seconds. Erickson then picked up his cell phone from inside the car and\nbegan to use it, appearing to scroll through an application. The officers instructed\nErickson to stop looking through his phone and to “blow into the tube” for the\nPBT. Erickson appeared to put his phone away. Erickson then said that he was\nout of breath. The officers responded that his shortness of breath should not\nmatter for purposes of registering a result in the test. Erickson then apparently\nfailed to provide a sufficiently long and steady breath for the PBT to work.\n\n\n\n\n        6\n           At the motion hearing, Officer Flora testified that, although he assumed that the bottle\ncontained only water, he was concerned that, if it instead contained alcohol, then drinking it could\n“taint” a PBT sample.\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\f                                                                          No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶32     In the next iteration of efforts by the officers, Officer Wedig held the\ntube up to Erickson’s face so that Erickson could try again to provide a breath\nsample. Erickson then attempted to get out of the car. Wedig blocked him from\ngetting out of the car. Erickson complained that the officers were violating his\nrights, took his phone back out, and resumed scrolling through it. Wedig told\nErickson that, if he did not cooperate in giving a sufficient breath sample for the\nPBT, then the officers would ask him to perform field sobriety tests. Wedig\npredicted that Erickson would fail field sobriety tests if subjected to them, and that\nthis would lead to Erickson’s arrest for drunk driving. Erickson took the position\nthat the officers lacked evidence that he had driven on a public roadway, as\nopposed to the privately owned parking lot. Erickson asked who had called the\nofficers to the scene (despite the fact that the officers had already told him,\naccurately, that it was the store manager who had called police). Erickson also\nasked to speak with a sergeant. Wedig instructed Erickson to get out of the car,\nand the officers placed Erickson in handcuffs.\n\n       ¶33     The circuit court made relevant findings of fact that included the\nfollowing: Erickson attempted to retract his initial statement to the officers that he\nhad been driving; he exhibited an “inability to follow police officer commands not\nto drink a clear liquid”; he displayed “odd behavior in scrolling through his phone\nwhile avoiding to answer questions asked of him”; and he appeared nervous and\nshowed “confrontational mannerisms.”             These findings individually and\ncollectively reasonably support the inference of consciousness of guilt. When they\nare considered as part of the totality of the circumstances, along with the facts\nsummarized above supporting the PBT request, probable cause to arrest was easily\nestablished.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                                                                          No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶34    Erickson contrasts the facts here with those of Renz, in which, to\nrepeat, our supreme court determined that an officer had the required degree of\nprobable cause to request the defendant to submit to a PBT. Erickson contends\nthat the Renz facts were “far more suspicious” than the facts here, and\naccordingly, the officers here could not have had probable cause to arrest. In\nRenz, an officer conducting a traffic stop was aware of the following indicia of\ndrunk driving when the officer requested that Renz perform a PBT: the traffic stop\ntook place at 2:00 a.m.; a strong odor of intoxicants came from inside the\ndefendant’s car; the defendant admitted to having had three beers; the officer had\nthe defendant undergo field sobriety tests, each of which the defendant was able to\n“substantially complete,” but the officer observed clues of intoxication for some,\nalthough not all, of the tests. See Renz, 231 Wis. 2d at 296-99, 316-17. The\ndefendant’s speech was not slurred. See id. at 317. Erickson notes that the court\nin Renz referred to this collection of facts as “exactly the sort of situation in which\na PBT proves extremely useful in determining whether there is probable cause for\nan OWI arrest.” Id. From this, Erickson argues that Renz “effectively held” that\nthe facts in Renz were insufficient to establish probable cause to arrest, which, to\nrepeat, is a higher quantum of evidence than “probable cause to believe” needed\nfor a PBT.\n\n       ¶35    I question whether Erickson properly interprets Renz as establishing\nthat facts approximating the level of evidence of drunk driving in Renz cannot\nconstitute probable cause to arrest. But setting this point to the side, I am not\npersuaded that the facts in Renz are “more suspicious” than the facts found by the\ncircuit court here.   Regarding the court’s findings here regarding Erickson’s\n“evasive,” “odd,” and “confrontational” behavior, Erickson asserts that these\nfindings show only that Erickson was “obstinan[t] and refus[ed] to cooperate with\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                                                           No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nlaw enforcement,” which he suggests should not count in the analysis. I disagree.\nWhen considered in the totality of the circumstances, these findings reasonably\nsupport both the specific inference that Erickson was intentionally uncooperative\nin a manner that reflected a guilty state of mind and the general determination of\nprobable cause that Erickson had driven while intoxicated.\n\n       ¶36    My conclusion that there was probable cause to arrest Erickson\ndefeats the basis of his challenge to the refusal.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n       ¶37    For all of these reasons, the judgment of the circuit court reflecting\nthe conviction and the court’s ruling on the refusal is affirmed.\n\n       ¶38    No costs awarded on the cross-appeal.\n\n              By the Court.—Judgment affirmed.\n\n              This    opinion   will   not     be    published.

Erickson challenges the court’s denial of his motion to\nsuppress evidence. Erickson argues that there was not sufficient evidence to\njustify a request by police that he submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT) before\nhis arrest. Erickson also contends that there was not sufficient evidence to support\nprobable cause to arrest him. I reject these arguments and accordingly affirm.2\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n        ¶2      City of Monona police cited Erickson with operating a motor vehicle\nwhile intoxicated in violation of WIS. STAT. § 346.63(1)(a) and operating with\nprohibited alcohol concentration in violation of § 346.63(1)(b). The police also\ngave Erickson a notice of intent to revoke his operating privileges for allegedly\nrefusing to submit to a chemical test of his breath after his arrest under\nWisconsin’s implied consent law. See WIS. STAT. § 343.305.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n            The City of Monona cross appeals, but I need not address the cross appeal. Explaining\nfurther, the City challenges the circuit court’s determination that Erickson was not guilty of\noperating under the influence of an intoxicant on the ground that there is “no evidence in the\nrecord to support a not guilty verdict.” The City states that its cross appeal is “protective,” by\nwhich it means that the cross appeal is intended to preserve an argument that, if Erickson is\nsuccessful in his appeal of the prohibited alcohol concentration conviction, the City should be\nallowed to pursue a judgment against Erickson for operating under the influence of an intoxicant\nand a corresponding sentence.

He appealed for a trial de novo in the circuit court.\n\n       ¶4     In circuit court, Erickson filed a motion to suppress evidence\nobtained as a result of what he alleged was an unlawful request that he undergo a\nPBT. In the alternative, he moved to suppress evidence later obtained following\nhis arrest on the ground that the arrest was unlawful.\n\n       ¶5     The circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on Erickson’s motion.\nIt was established that Erickson entered a retail store on the night of January 28,\n2020, and asked to borrow or purchase a shovel to dig his car out of some sort of\nsnow accumulation in a nearby parking lot. Store employees did not give him a\nshovel. A manager of the store testified that, based on observations of Erickson\nduring this encounter, the manager believed that Erickson was drunk, and the\nmanager called the police to report suspicion of an intoxicated driver.\n\n       ¶6     The two officers who were dispatched in response, Jared Wedig and\nLandon Flora, testified in pertinent part as follows. Wedig and Flora went to a\nparking lot near the store, where the officers encountered Erickson, who was by\nhimself. Erickson was attempting to use an umbrella to dig a car out of several\ninches of snow that had accumulated on that portion of the lot.\n\n       ¶7     Both officers smelled the odor of alcohol on Erickson’s breath,\nnoticed that his speech was slurred, and observed that Erickson had parked his car\nin an unplowed portion of the parking lot, which was well-lit, despite the fact that\na significant portion of the parking lot had been plowed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n        ¶8      The officers requested that Erickson undergo a PBT.                     Erickson\ninitially consented to do this, but he did not provide a breath sample sufficient to\ncreate a meaningful result. The officers continued to talk with Erickson for a time,\nand then placed him in handcuffs and moved him to the front of one of the\nofficers’ squad cars. This was because, according to Wedig, Erickson was “trying\n[to] play games or at least prolong the process” of determining whether Erickson\nwas impaired for purposes of operating a motor vehicle. The officers requested\nthat Erickson take the PBT again, but he declined. The officers then requested that\nErickson undergo field sobriety tests, which he also declined.\n\n        ¶9      Officers Wedig and Flora both recorded their interactions with\nErickson on body cameras. Portions of these recordings were played during the\nhearing and are preserved in the record on appeal.\n\n        ¶10     On July 26, 2023, the circuit court issued a written decision denying\nErickson’s motion. As part of its analysis, the court fully credited the testimony of\nthe store manager and the officers.\n\n        ¶11     The circuit court held a bench trial on the citations, which also\nserved as the refusal hearing.3 The store manager and the two police officers again\ntestified, with Officer Flora’s testimony now additionally covering events after\nErickson’s arrest. This included testimony that Flora read to Erickson from an\n“informing the accused” form, that Erickson refused to submit to a chemical test\nof his breath, and that Flora then obtained a warrant to test Erickson’s blood. A\nphlebotomist testified regarding a blood sample that she took from Erickson after\n\n        3\n          Erickson moved for a jury trial, which the circuit court denied in a ruling that Erickson\ndoes not challenge on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nhe was transported by police to an area hospital. Further, an employee of the state\ncrime laboratory testified regarding the testing of the blood sample, which\nreflected a blood alcohol concentration of .092 grams per 100 milliliters.\n\n       ¶12    The circuit court found Erickson not guilty of operating while under\nthe influence and guilty of operating with a prohibited alcohol concentration. The\ncourt further found that Erickson had refused, after his arrest, to submit to the\nrequested chemical test of his breath and that it was unreasonable for him to do so.\n\n       ¶13    Erickson appeals.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\n       ¶14    As noted, Erickson argues that the officers lacked the necessary level\nof probable cause to request that he undergo a PBT, and he further argues in the\nalternative that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him. I apply the\nfollowing standards of review to both issues.\n\n       ¶15    This court will “uphold the trial court’s findings of fact unless they\nare clearly erroneous.

This was despite the fact that a\nsubstantial portion of the well-lit lot had been plowed. Then, he was found trying\nto dig out the car with an umbrella.

In support, Erickson contends that the\naudio from the officers’ body camera recordings provides objective evidence that\nErickson did not slur his words—rather, he was at times difficult to understand\nonly because he was out of breath from attempting to dig his car out of the snow\nusing an umbrella.\n\n       ¶24    Based on my own review of the recordings from both officers, I\ncannot conclude that it is unreasonable to interpret Erickson’s speech as both\nbeing affected by his being out of breath and also slurred at times. There may be\nother reasonable interpretations of Erickson’s speech, but this does not establish\nclear error. See State v.

But this does not\nestablish clear error in finding that Erickson slurred some words. In a similar vein,\nErickson emphasizes that, when cross examined about Erickson’s slurred speech,\nthe officers declined to characterize the slurring as “moderate[] or heav[y].” For\nexample, Officer Wedig testified that Erickson’s speech “was slurred. I don’t put\na level on it as far as moderate or not.” But Erickson does not explain why the\ncourt was obligated to discount the officers’ testimony regarding slurring merely\nbecause they did not characterize the degree of slurring.\n\n       ¶25    Still on the slurred speech topic, Erickson contends that the circuit\ncourt should not have credited the testimony of the officers in part because the\nofficers were unfamiliar with Erickson’s normal manner of talking. Erickson\nquestions how the officers could have determined that what sounded to the officers\nlike slurred words might not in fact have been attributable to Erickson’s normal\nspeech patterns, given that some people in their everyday speech slur their words\nmore than other people and that Erickson was a stranger to the officers. However,\nthis argument fails because police officers are not required to rule out innocent\ninferences when assessing whether there is probable cause to believe that a drunk-\ndriving-related offense has occurred.

Erickson notes that\nOfficer Flora told Erickson that, if the officers determined that Erickson had “been\ndrinking,” then the officers were not going to allow him to “drive away,” and also\nnotes that later both officers told Erickson that, if the PBT reflected that he was\nbelow the legal limit, they would allow him to drive away. These statements can\nbe easily reconciled. In the first statement, the reference to “drinking” could\nreasonably be interpreted to mean consuming enough alcohol to put Erickson over\nthe legal limit, and consistent with that, a favorable PBT reading would put him in\nthe clear.4\n\n        ¶27     Erickson accurately observes that the officers here did not observe\nhim to have bloodshot or glassy eyes, nor did the officers observe him to display\n\n\n\n\n        4\n           For the first time in his reply brief on appeal, Erickson makes another argument based\non the officers’ statements about the possibility of Erickson avoiding detention, characterizing the\nofficers’ statements as a “ploy” or a “ruse.” The first problem with this argument is that it comes\ntoo late.

Further, the argument is not well\ndeveloped or supported.

But this additional evidence was not necessary to\nestablish the requisite level of probable cause.5\n\n        II. Probable Cause to Arrest\n\n        ¶28    Erickson argues that the circuit court should have suppressed\nevidence that police obtained after the moment when, in his view, he was arrested.\nSpecifically, he contends that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him\nwhen they placed him in handcuffs, at which time one of the officers told Erickson\nthat it was “too late” to provide a PBT. For purposes of this appeal, the City\nassumes that Erickson was arrested when the officers placed him in handcuffs, and\nI follow in that assumption. Taking that as the moment of arrest, I conclude that\nthe City has shown that the officers had probable cause to arrest Erickson at that\ntime.\n\n        ¶29    Our supreme court has explained the probable cause standard in this\ncontext as follows:\n\n               Probable cause to arrest for operating while under the\n               influence of an intoxicant refers to that quantum of\n               evidence within the arresting officer’s knowledge at the\n               time of the arrest that would lead a reasonable law\n               enforcement officer to believe that the defendant was\n               operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an\n               intoxicant. The burden is on the state to show that the\n               officer had probable cause to arrest\n\n                      The question of probable cause must be assessed on\n               a case-by-case basis, looking at the totality of the\n               circumstances. Probable cause is a “flexible, common-\n\n        5\n         Because I conclude that Officer Flora had probable cause to believe that Erickson had\ncommitted a drunk driving offense justifying the PBT request, I do not address the City’s\narguments that Erickson “waived” his challenge to the PBT request and that the appropriate\nremedy for an improper PBT request in this case is not suppression.\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n                sense measure of the plausibility of particular conclusions\n                about human behavior.” …. In determining whether there\n                is probable cause, the court applies an objective standard,\n                considering the information available to the officer and the\n                officer’s training and experience.\n\nState v.

But then Erickson walked around his car to the driver’s door,\nopened it, and sat down in the driver’s seat. After handing Officer Flora his\ndriver’s license, Erickson reached for a large, clear plastic bottle that appeared to\ncontain water. As Erickson uncapped the bottle, Officer Flora instructed him not\nto drink from it.6 Erickson responded that he was thirsty and took a drink lasting\nseveral seconds. Erickson then picked up his cell phone from inside the car and\nbegan to use it, appearing to scroll through an application. The officers instructed\nErickson to stop looking through his phone and to “blow into the tube” for the\nPBT. Erickson appeared to put his phone away. Erickson then said that he was\nout of breath. The officers responded that his shortness of breath should not\nmatter for purposes of registering a result in the test. Erickson then apparently\nfailed to provide a sufficiently long and steady breath for the PBT to work.\n\n\n\n\n        6\n           At the motion hearing, Officer Flora testified that, although he assumed that the bottle\ncontained only water, he was concerned that, if it instead contained alcohol, then drinking it could\n“taint” a PBT sample.\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\f                                                                          No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶32     In the next iteration of efforts by the officers, Officer Wedig held the\ntube up to Erickson’s face so that Erickson could try again to provide a breath\nsample. Erickson then attempted to get out of the car. Wedig blocked him from\ngetting out of the car. Erickson complained that the officers were violating his\nrights, took his phone back out, and resumed scrolling through it. Wedig told\nErickson that, if he did not cooperate in giving a sufficient breath sample for the\nPBT, then the officers would ask him to perform field sobriety tests. Wedig\npredicted that Erickson would fail field sobriety tests if subjected to them, and that\nthis would lead to Erickson’s arrest for drunk driving. Erickson took the position\nthat the officers lacked evidence that he had driven on a public roadway, as\nopposed to the privately owned parking lot. Erickson asked who had called the\nofficers to the scene (despite the fact that the officers had already told him,\naccurately, that it was the store manager who had called police). Erickson also\nasked to speak with a sergeant. Wedig instructed Erickson to get out of the car,\nand the officers placed Erickson in handcuffs.\n\n       ¶33     The circuit court made relevant findings of fact that included the\nfollowing: Erickson attempted to retract his initial statement to the officers that he\nhad been driving; he exhibited an “inability to follow police officer commands not\nto drink a clear liquid”; he displayed “odd behavior in scrolling through his phone\nwhile avoiding to answer questions asked of him”; and he appeared nervous and\nshowed “confrontational mannerisms.”             These findings individually and\ncollectively reasonably support the inference of consciousness of guilt. When they\nare considered as part of the totality of the circumstances, along with the facts\nsummarized above supporting the PBT request, probable cause to arrest was easily\nestablished.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                                                                          No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶34    Erickson contrasts the facts here with those of Renz, in which, to\nrepeat, our supreme court determined that an officer had the required degree of\nprobable cause to request the defendant to submit to a PBT. Erickson contends\nthat the Renz facts were “far more suspicious” than the facts here, and\naccordingly, the officers here could not have had probable cause to arrest. In\nRenz, an officer conducting a traffic stop was aware of the following indicia of\ndrunk driving when the officer requested that Renz perform a PBT: the traffic stop\ntook place at 2:00 a.m.; a strong odor of intoxicants came from inside the\ndefendant’s car; the defendant admitted to having had three beers; the officer had\nthe defendant undergo field sobriety tests, each of which the defendant was able to\n“substantially complete,” but the officer observed clues of intoxication for some,\nalthough not all, of the tests. See Renz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9715816\"><a href=\"/opinion/2093305/county-of-jefferson-v-renz/#296\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: County of Jefferson v.

But setting this point to the side, I am not\npersuaded that the facts in Renz are “more suspicious” than the facts found by the\ncircuit court here.   Regarding the court’s findings here regarding Erickson’s\n“evasive,” “odd,” and “confrontational” behavior, Erickson asserts that these\nfindings show only that Erickson was “obstinan[t] and refus[ed] to cooperate with\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                                                           No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nlaw enforcement,” which he suggests should not count in the analysis. I disagree.\nWhen considered in the totality of the circumstances, these findings reasonably\nsupport both the specific inference that Erickson was intentionally uncooperative\nin a manner that reflected a guilty state of mind and the general determination of\nprobable cause that Erickson had driven while intoxicated.\n\n       ¶36    My conclusion that there was probable cause to arrest Erickson\ndefeats the basis of his challenge to the refusal.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n       ¶37    For all of these reasons, the judgment of the circuit court reflecting\nthe conviction and the court’s ruling on the refusal is affirmed.\n\n       ¶38    No costs awarded on the cross-appeal.\n\n              By the Court.—Judgment affirmed.\n\n              This    opinion   will   not     be    published.

We affirm.\n\n             In 2006, Nickelberry was tried by a jury and ultimately found guilty\n\nof fifteen counts of first-degree robbery and three counts of theft by unlawful\n\ntaking over $300. The armed robberies were allegedly carried out by a group of\n\findividuals. The Commonwealth introduced the testimony of two such\n\nindividuals, Tommy Hardin and Jeanine Spicer, at Nickelberry’s trial. The circuit\n\ncourt sentenced Nickelberry to a total of seventy-years’ imprisonment. Thereafter,\n\nappellant pursued a direct appeal of his conviction, and in Appeal No. 2006-SC-\n\n000865-MR, 2008 WL 3890386 (Ky. Aug. 21, 2008), the Supreme Court affirmed\n\nsame on August 21, 2008.\n\n             Nickelberry later filed a Kentucky Rules of Criminal Procedure (RCr)\n\n11.42 motion arguing ineffective assistance of trial counsel and alleging violations\n\nof Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963), by the Commonwealth of\n\nKentucky. The circuit court denied the RCr 11.42 motion. An appeal was taken,\n\nand in Appeal No. 2012-CA-000082-MR, 2013 WL 19195445 (Ky. App. May 10,\n\n2013), the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for an evidentiary hearing as\n\nNickelberry’s allegations were not refuted upon the face of the record. Upon\n\nremand, the circuit court held a hearing and again denied the RCr 11.42 motion.\n\nNickelberry appealed, and in Appeal No. 2014-CA-001631-MR, 2018 WL 794776\n\n(Ky. App. Feb. 9, 2018), the Court of Appeals affirmed in part, vacated in part, and\n\nremanded with directions. The Court of Appeals directed the circuit court to\n\nrendered findings of fact and conclusions of law as to the alleged Brady, 373 U.S.\n\n83 violations. Upon remand, the circuit court complied with the directions and\n\ndetermined that the Commonwealth committed no violations of Brady, 373 U.S.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f83. An appeal ensued, and the Court of Appeals affirmed in Appeal No. 2019-CA-\n\n0626-MR, 2021 WL 12245217 (Ky. App. Feb. 19, 2021).\n\n             Nickelberry also filed the instant CR 60.02 seeking to vacate his\n\nsentence of imprisonment. The circuit court summarily denied the CR 60.02\n\nmotion by order entered March 24, 2023. This appeal follows.\n\n             It is well-settled that a CR 60.02 motion is an extraordinary remedy\n\nthat is only available to remedy a “substantial miscarriage of justice.” Wilson v.\n\nCommonwealth, 403 S.W.2d 710, 712 (Ky. 1966). Additionally, CR 60.02 is not a\n\nsubstitute for a direct appeal or an RCr 11.42 motion. CR 60.02 relief is only\n\navailable for issues that could not have been raised by direct appeal or RCr 11.42\n\nmotion. McQueen v. Commonwealth, 948 S.W.2d 415, 416 (Ky. 1997); Gross v.\n\nCommonwealth, 648 S.W.2d 853, 856 (Ky. 1983). And we review the circuit\n\ncourt’s denial of a CR 60.02 motion for an abuse of discretion. Foley v.\n\nCommonwealth, 425 S.W.3d 880, 886 (Ky. 2014).\n\n             Nickelberry contends that the circuit court erred by denying his CR\n\n60.02 motion. He initially claims that the Commonwealth of Kentucky violated\n\nBrady, 373 U.S. 83 by failing to disclose exculpatory evidence that would have\n\nproved that his co-defendants committed perjury. Nickelberry asserts that the\n\nCommonwealth committed fraud by stating that it did not have possession of\n\nstatements given to police by two of Nickelberry’s co-defendants.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f             The issue of whether the Commonwealth violated Brady, 373 U.S. 83\n\nwas previously adjudicated in Nickelberry’s RCr 11.42 motion. In its findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law, the trial court concluded that no Brady, 373 U.S. 83\n\nviolations occurred, which was affirmed on appeal by this Court (Appeal No.\n\n2019-CA-0626-MR). And Nickelberry’s claim of fraud by the Commonwealth\n\nlacks sufficient factual basis for this Court to review. We thus reject these\n\ncontentions of error.\n\n             Nickelberry also argues that the Commonwealth wrongfully used\n\ninadmissible and false evidence to obtain the indictment and his conviction. The\n\nadmissibility and sufficiency of evidence are issues that should have been raised in\n\na direct appeal or in an RCr 11.42 motion. CR 60.02 relief is not available for\n\nissues that could have been raised in a direct appeal or in an RCr 11.42 motion. As\n\nto his allegations of false evidence and fraud by the Commonwealth, Nickelberry\n\nhas failed to demonstrate same beyond mere conclusory allegations that are\n\nwithout sufficient factual bases.\n\n             Nickelberry next asserts that there is evidence demonstrating his\n\ninnocence of the crimes and that there was insufficient evidence to indict and\n\nconvict him of those crimes. He points out that D.N.A. at the scenes did not match\n\nhis D.N.A., fingerprints and palm prints at the scenes did not match his fingerprints\n\nand palm prints, affidavits from alibi witnesses demonstrate he could not have\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fcommitted the crimes, and no one matching Nickelberry’s description was\n\ndescribed to police by witnesses. These arguments go to the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence at trial and constitute direct appeal issues, which are not reviewable in a\n\nCR 60.02 motion. Gross, 648 S.W.2d at 856.\n\n             Based on our review of the record and for the reasons stated, we are of\n\nthe opinion that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion by denying\n\nNickelberry’s CR 60.02 motion. The order of the Jefferson Circuit Court is\n\naffirmed.\n\n             ALL CONCUR.\n\n BRIEF FOR APPELLANT:                      BRIEF FOR APPELLEE:\n\n Derwin I.

The ALJ found that Ellis Joiner (“Joiner”)\n\nsustained a work-related injury at MAC Construction and Excavation (“MAC\n\nConstruction”) on July 15, 2020 when he fell from a ladder. The ALJ awarded\n\fdisability benefits and medical benefits, but did not find Joiner to be totally and\n\npermanently disabled. Joiner appealed to the Board, asserting that the ALJ had\n\nerred by 1) failing to assess an impairment rating for a left shoulder injury; and, 2)\n\nfailing to assess an impairment rating for an injury to the cervical spine. The\n\nBoard found that the ALJ appropriately analyzed the evidence and explained the\n\nbasis for his decision; that the decision was supported by substantial evidence; and\n\nthat the law was properly applied. On appeal, Joiner presents the same arguments\n\nto this Court – that the Board erred in affirming the ALJ’s failure to assess any\n\nimpairment to Joiner’s left shoulder and cervical spine. Upon our review, we\n\naffirm the Board.\n\n                         FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n                 Joiner filed a Form 1011 alleging multiple injuries to his body,\n\nincluding his shoulders, right wrist, left elbow, and mid and low back, when he fell\n\nfrom a ladder in July 2020. He underwent multiple surgeries over the next few\n\nyears, including for a right wrist fracture, a left bicep tendon repair, and two rotator\n\ncuff repairs. He amended his Form 101 in 2022 to include allegations of a neck\n\ninjury. He filed over 160 pages of medical records with the initial Form 101,\n\noutlining his treatment with multiple medical providers. Dr. Barefoot evaluated\n\nJoiner at the request of his attorney and submitted a report assessing a 37%\n\n\n1\n    A Form 101 is the initial application for workers’ compensation benefits.\n\n                                                 -2-\n\fimpairment rating according to the American Medical Association (“AMA”)\n\nguidelines. That rating included an 8% impairment for the cervical spine and a 4%\n\nimpairment for the left shoulder. Dr. Barefoot disagreed with the assessment of\n\nDr. Ballard, who had evaluated Joiner at the request of MAC Construction. Dr.\n\nBallard assessed a total 12% impairment rating based upon AMA guidelines. She\n\ndid not assess any impairment to the cervical spine or to either shoulder.\n\n             Joiner also submitted a vocational report from Robert Tiell which\n\nconcluded that he was 100% occupationally disabled. MAC Construction filed a\n\nfunctional capacity evaluation report which concluded that Joiner was not\n\ncompletely unable to perform all work, and also submitted a report from Dr. Tien\n\nwhich assessed a whole person impairment rating of only 9%.\n\n             A benefit review conference was held on June 25, 2024, and the ALJ\n\nrendered his opinion, award and order on September 16, 2024. The ALJ found that\n\nJoiner sustained left upper extremity, right shoulder and wrist, and thoracic and\n\nlumbar injuries due to the work accident. The ALJ awarded permanent partial\n\ndisability benefits based upon a 24% impairment rating to the body as a whole and\n\nenhanced that by the multiplier contained in Kentucky Revised Statute\n\n342.730(1)(c)1. The ALJ stated that he had analyzed the facts and evidence\n\nconcerning the total occupational disability claim, consistent with City of Ashland\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fv. Stumbo, 461 S.W.3d 392 (Ky. 2015), and he did not find Joiner to be totally\n\ndisabled.2\n\n               Joiner petitioned for reconsideration, but other than correcting a\n\ntypographical error, the ALJ denied the petition. As he does here, Joiner asserted\n\nin his petition that the ALJ failed to address the impairment for the left shoulder\n\nand cervical spine. The ALJ explained his position on both of those contentions,\n\nas follows:\n\n               2. [Joiner] contends the ALJ failed to address the\n               appropriate impairment for the left shoulder injury.\n               [Joiner’s] Petition in this regard is overruled. Dr. Kuiper\n               assigned a 1% rating for [Joiner’s] shoulders, and while\n               he did not specify to which shoulder the 1% rating\n               applied, a reasonable inference would be the 1% was\n               assigned to [Joiner’s] right shoulder since the injury to\n               that shoulder represented a full thickness rotator cuff tear.\n               Thus, a reasonable inference would be that Dr. Kuiper\n               did not assign an impairment rating for the left shoulder.\n\n               3. [Joiner] also contends the ALJ erred by failing to\n               assign an impairment for [Joiner’s] alleged cervical spine\n               injury. This Petition is overruled as well. [Joiner] points\n               to evidence of cervical symptoms in November of 2020\n               as supportive of such a finding, however, the ALJ finds\n               this four-month delay in symptoms, as well as evidence\n               that Dr. Compton initially ordered only MRI scans of the\n               lumbar and thoracic spine, support the ALJ’s finding\n               Plaintiff did not sustain a significant cervical injury.\n\n               Joiner appealed to the Board, which affirmed; this appeal followed.\n\n2\n  The City of Ashland case requires a five-step analysis be performed to determine total\noccupational disability. On this appeal, Joiner does not assert that the ALJ failed to perform the\nrequired analysis.\n\n                                                -4-\n\f                             STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n               As factfinder, the ALJ has the sole authority to determine the “weight,\n\ncredibility, substance, and inferences to be drawn from the evidence.” Holcim v.\n\nSwinford, 581 S.W.3d 37, 39 (Ky. 2019) (quoting LKLP CAC Inc. v. Fleming, 520\n\nS.W.3d 382, 386 (Ky. 2017)). Where the evidence is conflicting, the factfinder\n\nmay choose whom and what to believe. Pruitt v. Bugg Brothers, 547 S.W.2d 123,\n\n124 (Ky. 1977) (citation omitted). The Board may not substitute its opinion for\n\nthat of the ALJ on the weight and credibility of the evidence. Whittaker v.\n\nRowland, 998 S.W.2d 479, 481 (Ky. 1999) (citing Kentucky Revised Statute\n\n342.285(2)).\n\n               As the claimant in a workers’ compensation claim, Joiner bore “the\n\nburden of proof and the risk of persuading the [B]oard in his favor.” See Snawder\n\nv. Stice, 576 S.W.2d 276, 279 (Ky. App. 1979) (citations omitted). Because Joiner\n\nwas unsuccessful before the ALJ regarding the left shoulder and cervical\n\nconditions, the question before the Board was whether the evidence was so\n\noverwhelming as to have compelled a finding in his favor. See Groce v. VanMeter\n\nContracting, Inc., 539 S.W.3d 677, 682 (Ky. 2018) (citations omitted).\n\nCompelling evidence is defined as evidence that is “so overwhelming that no\n\nreasonable person could reach the conclusion of the Board.” REO Mechanical v.\n\nBarnes, 691 S.W.2d 224, 226 (Ky. App. 1985). It is not enough for Joiner to\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fmerely show there is some evidence that would support a different result, but he\n\nmust show that the evidence was such that the findings were unreasonable. See\n\nSpecial Fund v. Francis, 708 S.W.2d 641, 643 (Ky. 1986).\n\n               “When reviewing one of the Board’s decisions, [the appellate] Court\n\nwill only reverse the Board’s decision when it has overlooked or misconstrued\n\ncontrolling law or so flagrantly erred in evaluating the evidence that it has caused\n\ngross injustice.” Dreisbach Wholesale Florists, Inc. v. Leitner, 655 S.W.3d 763,\n\n767 (Ky. App. 2022) (quoting Abbott Lab’ys v. Smith, 205 S.W.3d 249, 253 (Ky.\n\nApp. 2006)).\n\n                                     ANALYSIS\n\n               Applying those principles, we note that our review is limited, and\n\nJoiner’s burden is high. Joiner unquestionably sustained several injuries from his\n\nfall for which the ALJ awarded temporary total disability, permanent partial\n\ndisability, and medical benefits. However, the ALJ was simply not persuaded that\n\nJoiner sustained a cervical and left shoulder injury from the fall. On\n\nreconsideration, the ALJ outlined the basis for his determinations. He noted that\n\nthere was some delay in reporting any neck injuries and that Dr. Compton had only\n\nordered testing of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Similarly, on appeal, the Board\n\nrecognized its review of the entire record and that records evidencing neck pain\n\nwere not noted until 2022. The medical experts for MAC Construction did not\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fassess impairment to the cervical spine. The Board found there was evidence to\n\nsupport the ALJ’s determination that Joiner did not sustain a cervical injury from\n\nthe 2020 accident.\n\n             This is also true with regard to the left shoulder injury claim. Joiner\n\nasserts that the ALJ failed to address impairment for the left shoulder in his\n\nopinion and award. However, this was also raised on petition for reconsideration,\n\nand the ALJ specifically addressed that claim as well. The ALJ noted that he had\n\nrelied upon Dr. Kuiper, who assigned a 1% impairment to “the shoulders,” and\n\nstated he drew a “reasonable inference” that this was for Joiner’s right shoulder.\n\n             Joiner acknowledges that ALJs are given authority to make\n\n“reasonable inferences” from the evidence, but he argues that no reasonable person\n\ncould view this inference as reasonable. See Miller v. Go Hire, 473 S.W.3d 621,\n\n629 (Ky. App. 2015). We disagree. We accept that Dr. Barefoot assessed a 4%\n\nimpairment to the left shoulder. However, the fact that the ALJ accepted Dr.\n\nBarefoot’s assessment as to the right shoulder does not require that it be accepted\n\nfor the left shoulder. Dr. Ballard did not assess any impairment for Joiner’s\n\nshoulder conditions, and the ALJ was free to accept that as well. There was no\n\nchallenge or clarification asked of Dr. Kuiper as to whether his 1% impairment\n\nwas for the right shoulder only, but the ALJ was entitled to make that inference\n\nbased upon his review of all the evidence.\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f             The weighing of the evidence falls within the exclusive province of\n\nthe ALJ.

JONES, JUDGES.\n\nCOMBS, JUDGE: Appellant, Kendra Russell (Russell), appeals that portion of\n\nWorkers’ Compensation Board’s Opinion vacating the Administrative Law\n\nJudge’s award of the three-multiplier and remanding for additional findings. After\n\nour review, we affirm.\n\f            Russell was employed by the Appellee, International Automotive\n\nComponents (IAC), from June 2002 until June 25, 2021, the date on which the\n\nplant closed. On September 16, 2023, Russell filed an Application for Resolution\n\nof an injury claim (Form 101) against IAC alleging a June 25, 2021, cumulative\n\ntrauma injury to multiple body parts -- including her neck, shoulders, and back.\n\n            The claim was contested and the medical evidence was in conflict.\n\nRussell filed the Form 107 Report of Larry Oteham, D.O., who evaluated Russell\n\nat her attorney’s request. IAC filed reports from Dr. Mitchell Harris and Dr.\n\nGregory Snider, who performed Independent Medical Exams at IAC’s request.\n\nIAC also deposed Dr. Oteham, and Russell testified by deposition and at the final\n\nhearing.\n\n            On July 24, 2024, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) rendered an\n\nOpinion, Award, and Order, as follows in relevant part:\n\n            The ALJ relies upon Dr. Oteham to find Russell’s\n            cervical and shoulder conditions are related to her\n            performance of the blow molding and headliner jobs at\n            IAC. Russell testified credibly that performance of these\n            jobs involved considerable repetitive overhead lifting.\n            The ALJ has also considered that Russell performed\n            these jobs for almost twenty years. Drawing reasonable\n            inferences from this evidence has convinced the ALJ that\n            Russell’s neck and bilateral shoulder conditions [are]\n            partially attributable to her work with IAC.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f               The ALJ concluded that Russell’s low back condition was not work-\n\nrelated based upon the opinions of Dr. Harris and Dr. Snider. However, the ALJ\n\nfound that Russell had a combined 14% impairment for her work-related bilateral\n\nshoulder and cervical spine condition based on the opinion of Dr. Oteham.\n\nFurthermore, “[b]ased upon the testimony of Dr. Oteham,” the ALJ found that\n\n“Russell lacks the physical capacity to return to her pre-injury work at IAC, and\n\nshe is entitled to the 3.2 multiplier contained in KRS 342.730(1)(c)(2) [sic].”1\n\n               IAC filed a Petition for Reconsideration pursuant to KRS 342.281 and\n\nargued that the record did not support the ALJ’s award of the three-multiplier.\n\nWith respect to the finding that Russell lacked the physical capacity to return to her\n\npre-injury work, IAC argued that that finding was contrary to Russell’s testimony\n\nthat she was working without restrictions when she was laid off and had no plans\n\nof quitting. IAC requested additional findings of fact, including a finding\n\n“reconciling how Plaintiff worked without restrictions until she was laid off, at\n\nwhich point she had no plans of quitting, but is now incapable of returning to that\n\njob.”\n\n\n\n\n1\n As the Board explained at page 8, footnote 1, of its Opinion, “We note the three-multiplier is\ncontained in [Kentucky Revised Statute] 342.730(1)(c)1., not (1)(c)2. as stated by the ALJ;\nhowever, as we are remanding this claim on other grounds, the ALJ may correct any clerical\nerror on remand.”\n\n                                               -3-\n\f              On reconsideration, the ALJ clarified that the only conditions found to\n\nbe compensable are the bilateral shoulder and cervical conditions. Otherwise, the\n\nALJ denied IAC’s petition, stating that “the Defendant’s Petition seeking\n\nadditional findings and a further explanation of the basis for the award is\n\noverruled.”\n\n              IAC appealed to the Workers’ Compensation Board (Board) and\n\nraised two issues: (1) that substantial evidence did not support the ALJ’s\n\ndetermination that Russell’s neck and shoulder conditions were work-related; and\n\n(2) that it was an abuse of discretion to award the three-multiplier because the\n\nrecord was completely void of any testimony that Russell had any current work\n\nrestrictions or the inability to perform her prior job at IAC.\n\n              On January 31, 2025, the Board entered a detailed Opinion Affirming\n\nIn Part, Vacating In Part, and Remanding. On the issue of work-relatedness of the\n\nneck and shoulders, the Board affirmed. With respect to the award of the three-\n\nmultiplier, the Board vacated and remanded as follows in relevant part:\n\n                     The ALJ is required to recite the specific evidence\n              he relied upon in finding the three-multiplier applicable.\n              A general statement of reliance upon a particular doctor\n              is insufficient, as more detail is required. In his report,\n              Dr. Oteham opined Russell could “continue to perform\n              her work duties in the full-time setting she is currently\n              employed in.” Russell was working in a clerical data\n              entry position for a new employer at the time of Dr.\n              Oteham’s examination. Dr. Oteham did not mention any\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fspecific physical restrictions or whether she could\nperform her pre-injury work.\n\n       The ALJ was charged with analyzing the actual\ntasks the employee performed prior to the injury and then\nassessing the limitations and restrictions on her physical\nactivities resulting from the work-related injury. Voith\nIndustrial Services, Inc. v. Gray, 516 S.W.3d 817 (Ky.\nApp. 2017). Miller v. Square D Co., 254 S.W.3d 810,\n813-814 (Ky. 2008) stands for the proposition that a\nworker who can no longer perform all his required job\ntasks lacks the ability to return to the “type of work\nperformed at the time of injury.” Additionally, in Ford\nMotor Co. v. Forman, 142 S.W.3d 141 (Ky. 2004), the\nSupreme Court held that the type of work performed at\ntime of injury refers to the actual jobs the individual\nperformed. Finally, the evidence is reviewed as of the\ntime of the hearing to determine whether a claimant\ncould perform his pre-injury work. See Apple Valley\nSanitation Inc. v. Stambaugh, 645 S.W.3d 434, 438-439\n(Ky. 2022).\n\n       A worker’s testimony is competent evidence of his\nor her physical condition and of their ability to perform\nvarious activities both before and after being injured.\nHush v. Abrams, 584 S.W.2d 48 (Ky. 1979). The ALJ\nmay but is not compelled to rely upon the claimant’s self-\nassessment of their ability to perform their prior work.\nIra A. Watson Department Store v. Hamilton, supra.\n\n       The Board is not directing a particular result. The\nALJ must simply and adequately detail the evidence\nrelied upon in reaching his decision. Kentland Elkhorn\nCoal Corporation v. Yates, 743 S.W.2d 47 (Ky. App.\n1988). A party is entitled to know with some specificity\nthe reasons for the award, although certainly the ALJ is\nnot required to engage in a detailed discussion or set\nforth in minute detail the reasons for reaching a particular\nresult. Big Sandy Community Action Program v.\nChaffins, 502 S.W.2d 526 (Ky. App. 1973).\n\n                            -5-\n\f            Russell appeals and makes a generalized argument that the Board’s\n\ndetermination -- to vacate in part and remand -- was based upon a\n\nmisunderstanding of the evidence. IAC requests that the Board’s decision be\n\nupheld because the ALJ failed to adequately detail the evidence upon which he\n\nrelied.\n\n            The standard of our review is set forth in Tryon Trucking, Inc. v.\n\nMedlin, 586 S.W.3d 233 (Ky. 2019):\n\n            [L]ike any other issue in a workers’ compensation\n            proceeding, the appellate courts may review the Board’s\n            decision to remand to the ALJ for error, taking into\n            consideration . . . the Board’s wide discretion to do so.\n\n            [A]s always, we assess the Board’s decision to remand\n            based upon whether it has “overlooked or misconstrued\n            controlling statutes or precedent, or committed an error in\n            assessing the evidence so flagrant as to cause gross\n            injustice.”\n\nId. at 238 (quoting Western Baptist Hosp. v. Kelly, 827 S.W.2d 685, 687-88 (Ky.\n\n1992)).\n\n            We perceive no such error in the case before us. To the contrary, we\n\nagree with the Board’s thorough analysis. Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n            ALL CONCUR.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fBRIEF FOR APPELLANT:    BRIEF FOR APPELLEE\n                        INTERNATIONAL AUTOMOTIVE\nMcKinnley Morgan        COMPONENTS:\nLondon, Kentucky\n                        Donald J.

The civil rights action, hereinafter referred to as the underlying action,\n\nwas dismissed by the United States District Court for the Western District of\n\nKentucky as being time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Thus, to\n\nascertain damages against Baker, the underlying action was recreated in the legal\n\nmalpractice action in what is referred to as a “suit-within-a-suit.” Osborne v.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fKeeney, 399 S.W.3d 1, 10 (Ky. 2012). See also Marrs v. Kelly, 95 S.W.3d 856,\n\n860 (Ky. 2003).\n\n                                BACKGROUND\n\n            Andre Mulligan was downtown in Louisville, Kentucky, in the early\n\nmorning hours of September 2, 2012. Mulligan was an adult dancer and was\n\npreparing to work in a local establishment on Main Street. Mulligan was outside\n\nthe establishment when he observed a motor vehicle speeding past him; thereupon,\n\nMulligan yelled and motioned with his hand for the vehicle to slow down. The\n\nmotor vehicle then backed up on the one-way street, and Louisville Metro Police\n\nOfficer Timothy O’Daniel emerged from the vehicle.\n\n            The events that happened next are disputed. However, Mulligan\n\ntestified that Officer O’Daniel instructed Mulligan to approach him and then\n\ninstructed Mulligan to place his hands on the Officer’s motor vehicle. Mulligan\n\nstated that he complied with all directives of Officer O’Daniel. Nonetheless,\n\nMulligan recounted that Officer O’Daniel proceeded to place a handcuff on one of\n\nhis hands and told him that he was under arrest for public intoxication. Mulligan\n\ntestified that he told Officer O’Daniel that he had not committed a crime and had\n\nnot been drinking; thereupon, Officer O’Daniel thrust Mulligan to the ground\n\npenning Mulligan’s arm beneath him. Mulligan further testified that Officer\n\nO’Daniel placed his knees in his back and neck and beat him with his fists.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fEventually, Mulligan stated that he was placed into a police vehicle where Officer\n\nO’Daniel again beats him for saying that they were punk ass police, and another\n\nmember of LMPD, Officer Wayne Kapanski,1 begins twisting Mulligan’s neck.\n\nMulligan testified that he eventually played dead, so Officer O’Daniel and Officer\n\nKapanski would stop assaulting him.\n\n              By contrast, Officer O’Daniel testified that he was driving in a marked\n\npolice vehicle on Main Street in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, when Mulligan\n\nyelled at him. Officer O’Daniel then stated that he backed up his police vehicle to\n\ninvestigate. Officer O’Daniel could not recall how they started interacting but\n\nremembered that Mulligan came to his police vehicle. Officer O’Daniel then\n\ntestified that Mulligan appeared intoxicated by the way he was walking and that he\n\nsmelled of alcohol. Officer O’Daniel stated that he believed Mulligan was under\n\nthe influence of alcohol and told Mulligan he was being arrested for public\n\nintoxication. Officer O’Daniel testified that when he attempted to hand cuff\n\nMulligan, Mulligan squared up or reared back, and he was only able to place one\n\nhand cuff on Mulligan. At that point, Officer O’Daniel stated that he believed\n\nMulligan was actively resisting arrest. Eventually, Officer O’Daniel testified that\n\nhe and Mulligan ended upon the ground with Officer O’Daniel attempting to gain\n\n\n1\n  Officer Wayne Kapanski’s last name is sometimes spelled Kopanski. Throughout this Opinion,\nwe shall spell his last name as Kapanski as the circuit court did in its jury instructions and\njudgment.\n\n                                             -4-\n\fcontrol over Mulligan. According to Officer O’Daniel, he called for backup;\n\nMulligan was successfully restrained, and Mulligan was placed in the backseat of a\n\npolice vehicle. Officer O’Daniel charged Mulligan with public intoxication,\n\ndisorderly conduct, resisting arrest, menacing, and assault.\n\n              Mulligan engaged Baker to represent him in the criminal action, and\n\nthe circuit court eventually dismissed all criminal charges against Mulligan without\n\na probable cause stipulation. Mulligan then engaged Baker to represent him in a\n\ncivil action seeking damages from the officers and/or Louisville-Jefferson County\n\nMetro Government.\n\n              On April 24, 2014, Mulligan filed a complaint in the Jefferson Circuit\n\nCourt against Officer O’Daniel and Louisville-Jefferson County Metro\n\nGovernment for unlawful search and seizure, false arrest, use of excessive force,\n\nmalicious prosecution, and for violations of 42 United States Code (U.S.C.) §§\n\n1983, 1985, & 1986 (Mulligan v. O’Daniel, Action No. 14-CI-002286). The\n\naction was removed to the United States District Court, Western District of\n\nKentucky, Louisville Division (Mulligan v. O’Daniel, Civil Action No. 3:14-CV-\n\n00393-JHM).2 By summary judgment entered October 27, 2015, the U.S. District\n\n\n\n2\n For clarity in this Opinion, the civil action filed by Kenneth H. Baker on behalf of Andre\nMulligan for claims arising from actions of police officers of the Louisville Metro Police\nDepartment (LMPD), will be referred to throughout as the “underlying action.” The action filed\nagainst Baker by Mulligan will be referred to as the “malpractice” action.\n\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fCourt dismissed all claims based upon expiration of the one-year statute of\n\nlimitations, except the malicious prosecution claim. The U.S. District Court\n\nconcluded that the dismissed claims were not timely filed as the complaint was\n\nfiled (April 24, 2014) more than one year from Mulligan’s arrest (September 2,\n\n2012).3\n\n              Baker subsequently informed Mulligan that he may have committed\n\nmalpractice by failing to timely file the underlying action. Thereafter, Mulligan\n\nengaged attorney Kirk Laughlin from the Poppe Law Firm to represent him in a\n\npotential malpractice action against Baker. By letter dated June 28, 2016, Laughlin\n\ninformed Baker that Mulligan had retained Laughlin in relation to a possible\n\nmalpractice claim and requested a copy of Mulligan’s file. Baker then sent an\n\nemail to Mulligan and informed him that Baker could not continue to represent him\n\nin the U.S. District Court. The court permitted Baker to withdraw from\n\nrepresenting Mulligan in the action and gave Mulligan time to secure new legal\n\ncounsel. Nonetheless, Mulligan failed to secure legal counsel to represent him, and\n\nthe U.S. District Court dismissed the malicious prosecution claim for failure to\n\nprosecute on November 17, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n3\n The U.S. District Court concluded that § 1983 actions in Kentucky were limited by the one-\nyear statute of limitations found in Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 413.140(1)(a) and that\nMulligan’s state law claims were also barred by KRS 413.140(1)(a) and (1)(d).\n\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\f            Mulligan then filed the instant legal malpractice action against Baker\n\nin June of 2017. Baker timely answered the complaint. Baker later filed a third-\n\nparty complaint against Laughlin and the Poppe Law Firm. In the third-party\n\ncomplaint, Baker alleged:\n\n                  3. That, on or before June 24, 2016, the Plaintiff,\n            Andre Mulligan, hired the Defendant, Kirk A. Laughlin\n            and the Poppe Law Firm, to represent him for alleged\n            legal malpractice related to the underlying claim\n            Mulligan v. O’Daniel, in the U.S. District Court for the\n            Western District of Kentucky, Case No. 3:14-cv-00393.\n\n                  4. That the Plaintiff, Andre Mulligan, had\n            contracted with Defendant Baker to represent him in the\n            underlying claim, and in so contracting had agreed to\n            cooperate with Baker in regards to the underlying claim.\n\n                   ....\n\n                   7. That Defendant Baker had secured a settlement\n            offer in the underlying matter and that, upon the advice\n            and intentional interference of the Third Party\n            Defendants, the Plaintiff refused any cooperation with\n            Defendant Baker to facilitate the settlement of the\n            underlying matter.\n\n                  8. That the Plaintiff refused any cooperation or\n            communication with Defendant Baker, forcing Baker to\n            withdraw from the underlying matter and breaching the\n            contract between Baker and the Plaintiff.\n\n                   9. That the U.S. District Court advised Plaintiff\n            and Third Party Defendants of Defendant Baker’s request\n            to withdraw from the underlying claim on or about July\n            13, 2016, and subsequent thereto, and as to the necessity\n            for a subsequent attorney to enter an appearance in the\n            matter.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f                    10. That, despite the Court’s notice to the Third\n             Party Defendants, Laughlin and the Poppe Law Firm,\n             failed to represent Plaintiff in the underlying matter,\n             failed to advise Plaintiff of the need for him to secure an\n             attorney, and failed to advise him of the necessity to\n             mitigate any damages related to any alleged malpractice.\n\n                    11. That, as a result of the negligence of the Third\n             Party Defendants, Laughlin and the Poppe Law Firm, the\n             Plaintiff’s claim for malicious prosecution in Case No.\n             3:14-cv-00393 was dismissed on November 17, 2016.\n\n                    12. That, as a result of the contractual interference\n             of the Third Party Defendants, Baker suffered damages,\n             including the loss of attorney fees in settling or litigating\n             the underlying action.\n\n                    13. The Third Party Defendants failed to exercise\n             that degree of care and skill expected of reasonably\n             competent attorneys while representing Plaintiff,\n             resulting in significant financial loss and dismissal of\n             Plaintiff’s claim of malicious prosecution against Officer\n             O’Daniel. Such failure was negligent and/or grossly\n             negligent.\n\nThird-Party Complaint at 2-3.\n\n             A jury trial ensued on March 13, 2023, in Jefferson Circuit Court that\n\nlasted for five days. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of Laughlin and\n\nPoppe Law Firm upon Baker’s third-party claims, but Mulligan’s claims as\n\nasserted in the complaint were presented to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in\n\nfavor of Mulligan and found that Baker had committed malpractice. The jury\n\nawarded Mulligan damages of $250,000 for pain and suffering caused by Officer\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fO’Daniel’s and Officer Kapanski’s conduct in the underlying action and also\n\nawarded additional damages of $250,000 in pain and suffering caused by Baker’s\n\nmalpractice. As a result, the trial court rendered a Judgment on March 21, 2023,\n\nagainst Baker for a total of $500,000.\n\n              Baker filed Appeal No. 2023-CA-0707-MR and Mulligan filed Cross-\n\nAppeal No. 2023-CA-0740-MR. We shall initially address the arguments raised in\n\nAppeal No. 2023-CA-0707-MR and then Cross-Appeal No. 2023-CA-0740-MR.\n\n                           APPEAL NO. 2023-CA-0707-MR\n\n              To begin, Baker raises numerous issues on appeal. For purposes of\n\nfacilitating our review, we have categorically grouped the issues by subject matter\n\nto provide a cogent and orderly analysis which follows.\n\n                              I. EVIDENTARY RULINGS\n\n              As an appellate court, we review the trial court’s evidentiary rulings\n\nfor an abuse of discretion. Ky. Guardianship Adm’rs, LLC v. Baptist Healthcare\n\nSys., Inc., 635 S.W.3d 14, 20 (Ky. 2021). If the trial court abused its discretion as\n\nto an evidentiary ruling and the error is preserved, we must determine whether the\n\nerror affected the substantial rights of a party – whether the outcome of the\n\nproceeding would have been different.4 Kentucky Rules of Evidence (KRE) 103;\n\n\n4\n  During the course of the five-day trial, both parties made numerous objections to the\nintroduction of evidence and for other legal reasons. Unfortunately, when the parties reached the\nbench, the trial judge turned off the recording and the actual arguments made by either party for\n\n                                              -9-\n\fKentucky Rules of Civil Procedure (CR) 61.01; Crane v. Commonwealth, 726\n\nS.W.2d 302, 307 (Ky. 1987); Hawkins v. Rosenbloom, 17 S.W.3d 116, 121 (Ky.\n\nApp. 1999). Our review of this issue proceeds accordingly.\n\nA. Nose Fracture\n\n               Baker contends the trial court committed reversible error by\n\npermitting Mulligan to testify that he suffered a broken nose from being hit in the\n\nface by Officer O’Daniel. Baker points out that during trial, Mulligan testified that\n\nhis nose had been broken in a motor vehicle accident several months before his\n\narrest, had healed, and was broken again by Officer O’Daniel on the night of his\n\narrest. Baker believes that only a medical expert could testify concerning\n\nMulligan’s nose fracture. Baker also asserts that Mulligan was improperly\n\npermitted to refer to emergency room records during his direct examination. In\n\nfact, Baker alleges that Mulligan improperly read from the emergency room record\n\nduring his testimony.\n\n               During direct examination, Mulligan was asked to identify a photo of\n\nhim taken at the jail. Counsel then inquired what was different about this photo of\n\nhim. Mulligan responded that his nose was visibly slanted and that his nose was\n\nbroken. Mulligan pointed out that he knew his nose was broken by how slanted his\n\n\n\ntheir objections were not preserved. Neither party raised this issue before the trial court nor this\nCourt. Accordingly, we have relied on the parties’ arguments as set out in their briefs in our\nreview of these issues.\n\n                                                -10-\n\fnose was to one side. Mulligan also acknowledged that his nose was previously\n\nbroken in a car accident but that his nose was straight then. Mulligan also\n\ndescribed other injuries that were visible on the photo. Mulligan further testified\n\nthat upon being released from jail the next day, he went to the emergency room at\n\nSaint Mary’s Hospital. During his direct examination, Mulligan referred to records\n\nfrom the emergency room. He testified that he saw an emergency room doctor and\n\nhad multiple radiology tests. Reading from the emergency room records, Mulligan\n\nindicated that he was diagnosed with a left nasal bone fracture, among other\n\ninjuries. Mulligan stated that his nose was broken due to Officer O’Daniel\n\nrepeatedly striking Mulligan’s face.\n\n             In the Kentucky Rules of Evidence, two separate sections control the\n\nadmission of lay opinion evidence and expert opinion evidence. KRE 701 deals\n\nwith lay opinion evidence, and it provides:\n\n             If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness’\n             testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited\n             to those opinions or inferences which are:\n\n             (a) Rationally based on the perception of the witness;\n\n             (b) Helpful to a clear understanding of the witness’\n             testimony or the determination of a fact in issue; and\n\n             (c) Not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized\n             knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\n\nAnd KRE 702 deals with expert opinion evidence, and it provides:\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f            If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\n            will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or\n            to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an\n            expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\n            education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion\n            or otherwise, if the proponent demonstrates to the court\n            that it is more likely than not that:\n\n            (1) The testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data;\n\n            (2) The testimony is the product of reliable principles and\n            methods; and\n\n            (3) The witness’ opinion reflects a reliable application of\n            the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n\nAs an addendum to KRE 701, the notes of the Evidence Rules Review\n\nCommission explain:\n\n                   The amendments to Rules 701 and 702 must be\n            read together. The introduction and reliability of the\n            evidence is determined not by asking whether\n            the witness is lay or expert, but, instead, by asking\n            whether the testimony to be offered is lay or “scientific,\n            technical, or other specialized knowledge.” If it is of the\n            former, then Rule 701 is applicable. If it is of the latter,\n            then Rule 702 must be used.\n\nUnder KRE 701, a lay person is permitted to testify as to an apparent physical or\n\nbodily condition that is based upon his own first-hand perceptions and not based\n\nupon medical expertise. KRE 701; Equitable Life Assurance Society of United\n\nStates v. Fannin, 53 S.W.2d 703, 706 (Ky. 1932); see also R. Lawson, The\n\nKentucky Evidence Law Handbook, § 6.05[2] (2019 Edition).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f              In this case, Mulligan testified that his nose was swollen and slanted\n\nto one side, and based upon these observations, he believed his nose was broken.\n\nAdditionally, Mulligan read from emergency room records, wherein a diagnosis\n\nlisted was fracture to his nasal bone. The emergency room records from Saint\n\nMary’s Hospital were self-authenticating, and the records’ contents qualify under\n\nan exception to the hearsay rule. Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 422.300(2);\n\nKRE 803(6). So, Mulligan testified as to his lay opinion that he suffered from a\n\nbroken nose based upon his first-hand observations of his nose per KRE 701. Even\n\nif such lay opinion evidence were improper, Mulligan also read from the\n\nemergency room records entered into the record, wherein, he was diagnosed as\n\nsuffering a broken nose. As a result, we are unable to conclude that reversible\n\nerror occurred.\n\nB. Workers’ Compensation Opinion\n\n              Baker contends that the trial court committed reversible error by\n\nexcluding evidence that Mulligan had allegedly committed perjury during a\n\nworkers’ compensation proceeding.5 Baker states that Mulligan filed a workers’\n\ncompensation action approximately five years before his arrest. Baker asserts that\n\nin the opinion, the administrative law judge opined that Mulligan had committed\n\n\n\n5\n Baker entered the opinion into the record by offering it as an avowal exhibit. Kentucky Rules\nof Evidence 103(a)(2).\n\n                                             -13-\n\fperjury in the proceedings. Baker argues that this evidence of perjury was relevant\n\nfor impeachment purposes. Baker also believes that Mulligan opened the door to\n\nsuch impeachment when he testified that, “I’m never going to lie. I’m not lying.\n\nI’ll go to jail before I lie.” Baker’s Brief at 12. Baker argues that the opinion in\n\nthe workers’ compensation case should have been admitted, and the trial court\n\ncommitted reversible error by failing to do so.\n\n             KRE 611(b) provides that “[a] witness may be cross-examined on any\n\nmatter relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility.” KRE 608 deals\n\nparticularly with the evidence admissible to support a witness’s credibility or to\n\nimpugn same. KRE 608 provides:\n\n             (a) Opinion and reputation evidence of character. The\n               credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by\n               evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but\n               subject to these limitations: (1) the evidence may refer\n               only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and\n               (2) evidence of truthful character is admissible only\n               after the character of the witness for truthfulness has\n               been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or\n               otherwise.\n\n             (b) Specific instances of conduct. Specific instances of\n               the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or\n               supporting the witness’ credibility, other than\n               conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, may not\n               be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however,\n               in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness\n               or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination\n               of the witness: (1) concerning the witness’ character\n               for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the\n               character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another\n\n                                         -14-\n\f               witness as to which character the witness being cross-\n               examined has testified. No specific instance of conduct\n               of a witness may be the subject of inquiry under this\n               provision unless the cross-examiner has a factual basis\n               for the subject matter of his inquiry.\n\n             The giving of testimony, whether by an accused or by\n             any other witness, does not operate as a waiver of the\n             accused’s or the witness’ privilege against self-\n             incrimination when examined with respect to matters\n             which relate only to credibility.\n\n             At the discretion of the trial court, KRE 608(b) permits the cross-\n\nexamination of a witness concerning specific instances of past conduct that bear\n\nupon the truthfulness/untruthfulness of such witness; however, these specific\n\ninstances of conduct, other than criminal convictions, may not be proven by\n\nextrinsic evidence. See R. Lawson, The Kentucky Evidence Law Handbook, §\n\n4.25[4] (2019 Edition). Thus, counsel may ask a witness about such specific\n\ninstances of conduct but then “is stuck with whatever answer is given.” Allen v.\n\nCommonwealth, 395 S.W.3d 451, 462 (Ky. 2013). And it must be emphasized that\n\nthe decision to admit or exclude such an instance of past conduct is within the\n\ndiscretion of the trial court. KRE 608.\n\n             In this case, KRE 608 would allow the trial court, at its discretion, to\n\npermit Baker to cross-examine Mulligan about his alleged perjury in the workers’\n\ncompensation action. However, Baker would not have been permitted to introduce\n\nthe opinion into evidence. In this instance, the trial court exercised its discretion\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fand declined to permit the cross-examination or introduction of the opinion into\n\nevidence. Baker has failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby so doing.\n\n               The Kentucky Supreme Court has recognized that “when one party\n\nintroduces improper evidence, such ‘opens the door’ for the other party to\n\nintroduce improper evidence in rebuttal whose only claim to admission is that it\n\nexplains or rebuts the prior inadmissible evidence.” Metcalf v. Commonwealth,\n\n158 S.W.3d 740, 746 (Ky. 2005). While Mulligan did testify as to his truthfulness,\n\nthe trial court believed that introduction of the alleged perjury in the workers’\n\ncompensation proceeding would lead to undue prejudice. Under KRE 403, the\n\ntrial court may exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by undue\n\nprejudice. Here, the trial court particularly determined that the prejudicial effect of\n\nthe alleged perjury in the workers’ compensation action outweighed its probative\n\nvalue, and we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by so ruling.\n\nC. Underlying Damage Claims\n\n               Baker contends that the trial court committed reversible error by\n\nexcluding evidence related to Mulligan’s claim of damages against the police\n\nofficers for unlawful search and seizure, false arrest, use of excessive force,\n\nmalicious prosecution, and for violations of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985, and 1986. In\n\nparticular, Baker alleges that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence of\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f“Mulligan’s past, present, or future income or financial status.” Baker’s Brief at\n\n13. Baker points out that Mulligan testified that he suffered loss of reputation and\n\nloss of income due to his alleged false arrest. During discovery in the underlying\n\naction, Baker alleges that Mulligan’s tax documents demonstrate that he was being\n\nuntruthful concerning his financial losses, and such untruthfulness led to a\n\nbreakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Moreover, Baker believes that the\n\ntax documents were admissible under KRE 608(b).\n\n             As set forth above, KRE 608 permits the cross-examination of a\n\nwitness concerning specific instances of past conduct that bear upon the\n\ntruthfulness/untruthfulness of such witness; however, these specific instances of\n\nconduct, other than criminal convictions, may not be proven by extrinsic evidence.\n\nAnd the decision to admit or exclude such a specific instance of past conduct lies\n\nwithin the discretion of the trial court.\n\n             In this case, the trial court exercised its discretion under KRE 608 and\n\nexcluded such evidence of Mulligan’s finances. Additionally, it must be\n\nremembered that Mulligan did not seek to recover any damages for lost income or\n\nloss of reputation in the community. Rather, Mulligan only sought damages for\n\npain and suffering caused by the officers’ actions and for pain and suffering caused\n\nby Baker as a result of his malpractice. Therefore, Mulligan’s financial losses or\n\n\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\fgains were simply irrelevant to any damage claim. Upon the whole, we do not\n\nbelieve that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding this evidence.\n\nD. Evidence of Prior Assault of Mulligan by LMPD\n\n              Baker also contends that the trial court erred by excluding evidence of\n\na prior assault allegedly carried out by off-duty LMPD officers upon Mulligan in\n\nAugust of 2012, during an incident that occurred at Fourth Street Live in\n\nLouisville, Kentucky.6 Baker asserts that Mulligan had alleged that one off-duty\n\nLMPD officer put a gun to his head and told him to leave the venue. Thereafter,\n\nBaker points out that Mulligan filed a civil action, which was ultimately settled.\n\nBaker believes that evidence of this incident was relevant to Mulligan’s state of\n\nmind at the time of his arrest by Officer O’Daniel some two weeks later and upon\n\nMulligan’s damage claims.\n\n              In August of 2012, Mulligan was at Fourth Street Live when an\n\nincident occurred between him and one or more off-duty LMPD officers working\n\nas security. The August of 2012 incident did not involve physical injuries and did\n\nnot result in Mulligan’s arrest. Even if relevant, the probative value of the incident\n\nis weak at best; however, this slight probative value is substantially outweighed by\n\nits prejudicial effect on the jury. KRE 403. For this reason, we must conclude that\n\n\n\n6\n The off-duty police officers were employed by a private company providing security for Fourth\nStreet Live businesses.\n\n                                            -18-\n\fthe trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence of the August of\n\n2012 incident.\n\n                                   II. MISTRIAL\n\n             Baker also asserts that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a\n\nmistrial. Baker argues that he was entitled to a mistrial due to “ambush testimony\n\nby Mulligan regarding an undisclosed surgery” to repair his alleged broken nose.\n\nBaker’s Brief at 11. More specifically, Baker contends that Mulligan improperly\n\ntestified that he had surgery to repair his broken nose because the bones were\n\ncrushed, and the surgery was necessary to save his life. However, Baker points out\n\nthat he was never informed about the nose surgery and argues the introduction of\n\nsuch evidence constitutes trial by ambush.\n\n             As to a mistrial, the Kentucky Supreme Court has held:\n\n                    It is universally agreed that a mistrial is an extreme\n             remedy and should be resorted to only when there is a\n             fundamental defect in the proceedings which will result\n             in a manifest injustice. The occurrence complained of\n             must be of such character and magnitude that a litigant\n             will be denied a fair and impartial trial and the prejudicial\n             effect can be removed in no other way.\n\nGould v. Charlton Co., Inc., 929 S.W.2d 734, 738 (Ky. 1996).\n\n             In this case, we do not believe that Mulligan’s testimony concerning a\n\nsurgery on his nose to repair a fracture was sufficiently egregious to justify a\n\nmistrial. Baker was cross-examining Mulligan when Mulligan stated he had\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fundergone nose surgery, and Baker then continued to question Mulligan about the\n\nnose surgery. At that time, Baker made no objection to Mulligan’s testimony\n\nconcerning the nose surgery. In fact, Baker only objected to Mulligan’s testimony\n\nthe day after it occurred and at that time requested the mistrial. To be entitled to a\n\nmistrial, there must occur during trial a “fundamental defect,” and it “must be of\n\nsuch character and magnitude that a litigant will be denied a fair and impartial trial\n\nand the prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.” Id. Baker has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that such fundamental defect occurred. Consequently, we conclude\n\nthat the trial court properly denied Mulligan’s motion for mistrial.\n\n                            III. JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n             Baker next argues that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury.\n\nHe has made sundry arguments attacking the substance of the jury instructions, and\n\nwe will address each argument.\n\n             To begin, jury instructions must be based upon the evidence\n\nintroduced at trial, correctly state the law, and be intelligible to the jury. Mendez v.\n\nUniv. of Ky. Bd. of Trustees, 357 S.W.3d 534, 538-39 (Ky. App. 2011). Kentucky\n\nfollows the bare bones approach to jury instructions. Under the bare bones\n\napproach, the “jury instructions should refrain from elaborating on an abundance\n\nof detail, but still strike the proper balance in providing enough information to a\n\n\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\fjury to make it fully aware of the respective legal duties of the parties.” Olfice,\n\nInc. v. Wilkey, 173 S.W.3d 226, 229 (Ky. 2005).\n\n             Additionally, CR 51(3) sets forth the requirements for preserving\n\nobjections to jury instructions:\n\n             No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to\n             give an instruction unless he has fairly and adequately\n             presented his position by an offered instruction or by\n             motion, or unless he makes objection before the court\n             instructs the jury, stating specifically the matter to which\n             he objects and the ground or grounds of his objection.\n\nTherefore, a party must set forth the grounds of his objection or offer a proposed\n\njury instruction that fairly and adequately presents the party’s position before the\n\ntrial court instructs the jury in order to preserve the error for appellate review.\n\nNorton Healthcare, Inc. v. Disselkamp, 600 S.W.3d 696, 709 (Ky. 2020).\n\nMoreover, proposed jury instructions will not fairly and adequately present the\n\nparty’s position and will not properly preserve an objection as to the substance of a\n\njury instruction when:\n\n             (1) the omitted language or instruction was not contained\n             in the instruction tendered to the trial court; i.e., when the\n             allegation of error was not presented to the trial court at\n             all; (2) the minor differences between the language of the\n             tendered instruction and the instruction given by the trial\n             court would not call the trial court’s attention to the\n             alleged error; or (3) the tendered instruction itself was\n             otherwise erroneous or incomplete.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fSand Hill Energy, Inc. v. Smith, 142 S.W.3d 153, 163-64 (Ky. 2004). A properly\n\npreserved objection to the substance of a jury instruction presents an issue of law,\n\nand our review is de novo. Disselkamp, 600 S.W.3d at 709.\n\nA. Instruction No. 1 – Causation\n\n             In Instruction No. 1, Baker points out that the jury was initially\n\ninstructed to find whether he committed legal malpractice, and then in Instruction\n\nNo. 2, the jury was instructed upon the underlying claims of unlawful search and\n\nseizure, false arrest, use of excessive force, and malicious prosecution in relation to\n\nOfficer O’Daniel and/or Officer Kapanski. Baker maintains that the order of the\n\njury instructions was incorrect as the jury must initially be instructed on the\n\nunderlying claims, and if those claims are successful, the jury then proceeds to the\n\nlegal malpractice instruction. By reversing the order of the jury instructions, Baker\n\nbelieves that the jury findings as to causation were fatally flawed.\n\n             Baker filed proposed jury instructions wherein the jury was initially\n\ninstructed upon the underlying claims and thereafter instructed upon the legal\n\nmalpractice. Thus, this issue was preserved for appellate review.\n\n             In a legal malpractice action, it is well-established that:\n\n             [A] plaintiff . . . has the burden of proving: “[(]1) that\n             there was an employment relationship with the\n             defendant/attorney; [(]2) that the attorney neglected his\n             duty to exercise the ordinary care of a reasonably\n             competent attorney acting in the same or similar\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\f             circumstances; and (3) that the attorney’s negligence was\n             the proximate cause of damage to the client.”\n\nOsborne v. Keeney, 399 S.W.3d 1, 9-10 (Ky. 2012) (quoting Marrs v. Kelly, 95\n\nS.W.3d 856, 860 (Ky. 2003)). Where an attorney’s alleged negligence results in an\n\naction being barred by the statute of limitations, “a plaintiff must recreate an action\n\nthat was never tried [and] must bear the burden the plaintiff would have borne in\n\nthe original trial.” Id. at 10 (footnote omitted). At the same time, the attorney may\n\nadvance any defense that would be available to a defendant in the original trial. Id.\n\nThis is commonly referred to as “the suit-within-a-suit approach.” Id. at 10. When\n\ninstructing the jury under the suit-within-a-suit approach, the jury should initially\n\nbe “instructed on the underlying action and then asked to find whether the attorney\n\nwas negligent or not.” Id. at 12.\n\n             In this case, Instruction No. 1 asked the jury whether Baker was\n\nnegligent in his representation of Mulligan, and if the jury found Baker negligent,\n\nInstruction No. 2 then asks the jury to determine whether Mulligan would have\n\nsucceeded upon his claims of unlawful search and seizure, false arrest, use of\n\nexcessive force, and malicious prosecution against Officer O’Daniel and/or Officer\n\nKapanski. In so instructing the jury, the trial court plainly instructed the jury\n\ninitially upon the malpractice claim and thereafter, the underlying action.\n\n             Our case law holds in this type of case that the jury should ideally be\n\ninstructed on the underlying action and then on the malpractice action. Osborne,\n\n                                         -23-\n\f399 S.W.3d at 9-12. However, the instructions must be viewed as a whole.\n\nCarmical v. Bullock, 251 S.W.3d 324, 328 (Ky. App. 2007). Here, the trial court\n\nproperly instructed the jury upon the substantive law as to malpractice and upon\n\nthe substantive law as to the original claims in the underlying action for unlawful\n\nsearch and seizure, false arrest, use of excessive force, malicious prosecution, and\n\nfor violations of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985, and 1986 against Officer O’Daniel\n\nand/or Officer Kapanski. Considering the jury instructions as a whole, we cannot\n\nconclude that the mere sequence of the jury instructions in this case resulted in\n\nprejudicial error. Disselkamp, 600 S.W.3d at 724.\n\nB. Instruction No. 1 – Duty of Mulligan\n\n             Baker also contends that jury Instruction No. 1 failed to set forth\n\nMulligan’s duties to peacefully submit to arrest, to exercise ordinary care for his\n\nown safety, and to obey law enforcement orders. Baker tendered jury instructions\n\nthat included these duties; thus, this issue is preserved for our review. Baker\n\nfurther alleges that such duties should have been included in the jury instructions\n\nfor false arrest and excessive force. We disagree.\n\n             As concerns excessive force, the jury was instructed in Instruction No.\n\n2, to find whether Officer O’Daniel and/or Officer Kapanski used unreasonable\n\nforce against Mulligan, and unreasonable force was defined as that force which is\n\nunreasonable under the circumstances. In determining whether unreasonable force\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fwas used, the jury was instructed to consider whether Mulligan was actively\n\nresisting arrest or attempting to flee arrest. So, the jury was instructed to consider\n\nMulligan’s conduct within the context of resisting arrest or attempting to flee. The\n\njury instructions upon excessive force fairly and accurately stated the law and\n\ncomplied with the bare bones approach for jury instructions in Kentucky. See\n\nMendez, 357 S.W.3d at 538; Olfice, Inc., 173 S.W.3d at 229.\n\n             As to the jury instruction upon false arrest, also set forth in Instruction\n\nNo. 2, the jury was instructed that Mulligan must prove that Officer O’Daniel\n\narrested Mulligan, Officer O’Daniel did not have probable cause to arrest\n\nMulligan, and Officer O’Daniel acted under color of law in arresting Mulligan.\n\nThe jury was also instructed that probable cause existed “if, at the moment the\n\narrest was made, a reasonable person in Officer O’Daniel’s position would have\n\nbelieved that Mr. Mulligan had committed or was committing a crime.” This\n\ninstruction correctly stated the law upon false arrest and was again consistent with\n\nthe bare bones approach to jury instructions. See Mendez, 357 S.W.3d at 538-39;\n\nOlfice, Inc., 173 S.W.3d at 229. Therefore, we conclude that the jury was properly\n\ninstructed upon false arrest and excessive force.\n\nC. Instruction No. 2 – Unlawful Search and Seizure, False Arrest, Use of\nExcessive Force, and Malicious Prosecution\n\n             In Instruction No. 2, Baker maintains that the trial court erred by\n\ncombining the claims of unlawful search and seizure, false arrest, use of excessive\n\n                                         -25-\n\fforce, and malicious prosecution into one jury instruction (Instruction No. 2).\n\nBaker alleges that Instruction No. 2 was ambiguous and confusing. Baker\n\ncomplains that Instruction No. 2 contained broad concepts and was modeled after\n\nfederal jury instructions.\n\n             Baker states that he preserved this error by submitting proposed jury\n\ninstructions that separated each claim, and we agree.\n\n             While the trial court did combine the underlying claims (unlawful\n\nsearch and seizure, false arrest, use of excessive force, and malicious prosecution)\n\ninto Instruction No. 2, the instruction clearly separated each claim and set forth the\n\nrelevant law applicable to such claim. The combining of the underlying claims of\n\nunlawful search and seizure, false arrest, use of excessive force, and malicious\n\nprosecution into one jury instruction is not per se erroneous. Rather, the jury\n\ninstruction must correctly state the law and do so in an intelligible manner. See\n\nMendez, 357 S.W.3d at 538-39. Instruction No. 2 was plainly written, and the jury\n\nwas clearly instructed upon the law. Moreover, while Baker alleges the trial court\n\nerred by allegedly adopting federal jury instructions, Baker fails to specify how the\n\nadopted “federal” instructions were particularly erroneous.\n\nD. Instruction No. 2 – Terry Stop\n\n             Baker argues that the trial court misstated the law in Instruction No. 2\n\nby requiring Officer O’Daniel to possess probable cause to arrest Mulligan.\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\fAccording to Baker, Officer O’Daniel could have stopped Mulligan under Terry v.\n\nOhio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968) and needed only possess a reasonable suspicion of\n\ncriminal activity to do so. Additionally, Baker argues that Instruction No. 2\n\nerroneously set forth the law as to Officer O’Daniel’s search of Mulligan and again\n\nargues that the search was justified under Terry, 392 U.S. 1. Mulligan claims that\n\nthis issue is preserved by his proposed jury instructions.\n\n             However, a review of Baker’s proposed jury instructions reveal that\n\nBaker failed to offer an instruction consistent with Terry, 392 U.S. 1. In Baker’s\n\nproposed jury instructions, there is no instruction that Officer O’Daniel was\n\npermitted to stop and pat down Mulligan if he possessed a reasonable suspicion of\n\ncriminal activity. Baker stated that this objection was preserved by the filing of his\n\nproposed jury instructions. From a review of the proposed jury instructions, it is\n\nclear that the instructions do not fairly and adequately present Baker’s objection so\n\nas to preserve same for appellate review. Thus, this allegation of error is not\n\npreserved for our review.\n\nE. Instruction No. 2 – Officer O’Daniel and Officer Kapanski\n\n             Baker also assigns error in Instruction No. 2 as Officer O’Daniel and\n\nOfficer Kapanski were both included in some of the claims, and as a result, Baker\n\ncontends that it is impossible to discern the jury’s findings as to each officer:\n\n                    It cannot be deciphered from the trial court’s\n             Instruction whether the jury believed Mulligan met his\n\n                                         -27-\n\f             burden for liability against one or both of the officers.\n             As a result, the verdict does not support the burden of\n             proof being met against either officer. Here again, a\n             patchwork of findings on the part of the jury, none of\n             which 9 jurors agree upon, is easily possible. If Mulligan\n             convinced four jurors that Officer O’Daniel only was\n             liable, four others that Officer Kapanski was liable, and\n             the four remaining that both were liable, he should not be\n             entitled to a verdict. . . .\n\nBaker’s Brief at 23.\n\n             Instruction No. 2 was not erroneous for including both Officer\n\nKapanski and Officer O’Daniel. In Instruction No. 2, the jury unanimously agreed\n\nthat Mulligan “could have succeeded on at least one of his underlying civil rights\n\nclaims against Officer O’Daniel (false arrest, unlawful search, unlawful seizure, or\n\nmalicious prosecution) or Mr. Mulligan could have succeeded on his excessive\n\nforce claim against Officer O’Daniel and/or Officer Kapanski.” As to the\n\nagreement of jurors in a civil action, KRS 29A.280(3) provides, in relevant part,\n\n“[t]he agreement of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the jurors is required for a verdict\n\nin all civil trials by jury in Circuit Court.” Instruction No. 2 did not violate this\n\nstatutory requirement that nine jurors must agree for a verdict in a civil action. The\n\njury unanimously agreed upon Instruction No. 2, which included both Officer\n\nO’Daniel and Officer Kapanski. We, thus, reject Baker’s argument on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\fF. Instruction No. 4 – Damages\n\n               In Instruction No. 4, Baker contends that the trial court erred by\n\ninstructing the jury it could award damages for mental pain and suffering caused\n\nby his legal malpractice. Baker argues that damages for such emotional pain and\n\nsuffering are outside the scope of permissible damages in a legal negligence claim.\n\nBaker maintains that damages in a legal malpractice claim are limited to those\n\ndamages that could have been recovered in the underlying action. Additionally,\n\nBaker asserts that damages for emotional pain and suffering is limited to severe or\n\nserious emotional injuries that must be proven by expert testimony. Osborne, 399\n\nS.W.3d at 17-18.\n\n               KRS 411.165(1) provides that “[i]f any attorney employed to attend to\n\nprofessional business neglects to attend to the business, after being paid anything\n\nfor his services, or attends to the business negligently, he shall be liable to the\n\nclient for all damages and costs sustained by reason thereof.”7 As noted, the\n\nSupreme Court has recognized that Kentucky follows the suit-within-a-suit\n\napproach as to legal malpractice. Osborne, 399 S.W.3d at 11. Under this\n\napproach, “it must be shown that the attorney violated the standard of care and that\n\n\n7\n  The Supreme Court of Kentucky has held that a claimant may recover punitive damages for\nthe attorney’s own conduct if that conduct amounts to “fraud, ill will, recklessness, wantonness,\noppressiveness, (or) willful disregard of the (client’s) rights.” Osborne v. Keeney, 399 S.W.3d 1,\n23 (Ky. 2012) (quoting Hendry v. Pelland, 73 F.3d 397, 400 (D.C. Cir. 1996)).\n\n\n\n                                              -29-\n\fsuch violation was the proximate cause of injury to the client, i.e., the client would\n\nhave been successful in the underlying claim but for the negligence of the\n\nattorney.” Id. at 12. On its face, the statute looks to the recovery of those damages\n\nthat could have been recovered in the underlying claim absent the attorney’s\n\nnegligence.\n\n              In this case, the jury was instructed upon pain and suffering damages\n\nthat would have been recoverable in the underlying action as well as pain and\n\nsuffering damages from Baker’s negligent conduct in the malpractice action.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court in Osborne, 399 S.W.3d at 17-18, appears to allow pain\n\nand suffering claims against a negligent attorney in malpractice actions, such\n\nalleged injuries are only compensable if severe or serious and must be supported\n\nby expert medical proof. Id. Mulligan failed to establish that he suffered a severe\n\nor serious injury from Baker’s negligent conduct and likewise failed to present any\n\nexpert medical proof to support the claim. Mulligan argues that Indiana Insurance\n\nCo. v. Demetre, 527 S.W.3d 12 (Ky. 2017), precludes the necessity for expert\n\nproof in this case. We disagree. While Demetre is an insurance bad faith case, not\n\nattorney negligence, the Supreme Court nonetheless held that expert medical proof\n\nwas still required in cases of intentional or negligent infliction of emotional\n\ndistress. Demetre, 527 S.W.3d at 39. In this case, the alleged injuries are a direct\n\nresult of Baker’s alleged negligent conduct in the legal representation of Mulligan.\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\fBased on the undisputed facts of this case, Mulligan’s bare allegation of pain and\n\nsuffering, directly attributable to Baker’s actions apart from the underlying case,\n\nare not sufficient to sustain the claim.8 As the Supreme Court succinctly stated in\n\nOsborne: “Distress that does not significantly affect the plaintiff[’]s everyday life\n\nor require significant treatment will not suffice.” Osborne, 399 S.W.3d at 17.\n\n              Effectively, the jury instruction error resulted in a duplicative\n\nrecovery for the pain and suffering damages that Mulligan was entitled to in the\n\nunderlying action. Accordingly, we conclude that the circuit court erred by\n\ninstructing the jury upon damages for emotional pain and suffering caused by\n\nBaker’s conduct (Verdict Form No. 4) in the malpractice case and reverse the\n\njury’s verdict thereupon.9\n\nG. Instruction No. 4 – Apportionment\n\n              Baker alleges that the trial court committed error by failing to instruct\n\nthe jury to apportion liability between Mulligan, Baker, and the Poppe Law Firm.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n\n\n8\n Mulligan also argues that KRS 411.165 permits the award of pain and suffering based upon\nBaker’s negligence. Based on our review of the facts of this case, the statute provides no\nadditional basis to award any damages against Baker, other than those damages Mulligan was\nentitled to in the underlying action.\n9\n  As will be discussed later in this Opinion, we affirm the damages awarded to Mulligan for pain\nand suffering based upon Officer Timothy O’Daniel’s and Officer Wayne Kapanski’s conduct in\nthe underlying action. However, we have reversed the award of damages for pain and suffering\nbased upon Baker’s malpractice in his representation of Mulligan in the underlying action.\n\n                                             -31-\n\f             As subsequently set forth in this Opinion, Baker’s third-party claims\n\nagainst the Poppe Law Firm were properly dismissed by directed verdict; thus, the\n\ntrial court correctly declined to instruct the jury to apportion liability to the law\n\nfirm. And as for Mulligan, Baker failed to introduce evidence that Mulligan was\n\nnegligent after Baker withdrew from the underlying action in federal court.\n\nTherefore, the trial court correctly declined to instruct the jury on apportionment.\n\n    IV. DENIAL OF DIRECTED VERDICT – QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\n\n             Baker contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion for\n\ndirected verdict as the claims against Officer O’Daniel and Officer Kapanski were\n\nbarred by qualified immunity. In particular, Baker argues:\n\n             [A]ll of Mulligan’s underlying claims should be barred\n             by Qualified Immunity, as would have been available\n             defense by Officer O’Daniel in the underlying litigation,\n             for a variety of reasons. Most critically, by Mulligan’s\n             various admissions in prior sworn testimony, judged\n             from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene\n             in September 2012, a reasonable jury could not find there\n             was not sufficient articulable suspicion for the initial stop\n             and probable cause for arrest for alcohol intoxication.\n             Furthermore, a police officer in similar circumstance’s\n             perspective, by Mulligan’s prior sworn testimony, would\n             interpret his actions as resisting arrest justifying an\n             application of minimal force. Despite Mulligan’s\n             description of the force used, application of minimal\n             force is the most reasonable [the] jury could believe\n             Mulligan credibly demonstrated.\n\n                    ....\n\n\n\n\n                                          -32-\n\f                    Given the extent, or lack thereof, of documented\n             injuries to Mulligan . . . , [Mulligan] cannot point to any\n             case that “clearly establishes” that it was a violation of\n             the law for an officer in September 2012 to use minimal\n             force, resulting in no injuries, using no weapons, to\n             effectuate a mandatory arrest on an intoxicated subject\n             actively resisting arrest. As a result, all of [Mulligan’s]\n             Fourth Amendment claims in the underlying action\n             would have been dismissed because of Qualified\n             Immunity.\n\nBaker’s Brief at 27-29.\n\n             As to claims alleging violations of the Fourth Amendment under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983, an official may assert qualified immunity as a shield to such claims.\n\nBrowning v. Edmonson Cnty., Ky., 18 F.4th 516, 523 (6th Cir. 2021). Under the\n\ndoctrine of qualified immunity, a government official who is performing a\n\ndiscretionary act is entitled to such immunity provided his conduct does not violate\n\nclearly established statutory or constitutional rights a reasonable person would\n\nhave known. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 672 (2009); Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n\n457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). So, qualified immunity is not available if the official’s\n\nconduct violates a clearly established statutory or constitution right. Pearson v.\n\nCallahan, 555 U.S. 223, 232 (2009).\n\n             In this case, Mulligan clearly provided significant evidence that\n\nOfficer O’Daniel lacked probable cause to arrest Mulligan, performed a search that\n\nlacked probable cause or reasonable suspicion of a crime, instituted criminal\n\nproceedings without probable cause, and that both Officer O’Daniel and Officer\n\n                                         -33-\n\fKapanski used excessive force to arrest Mulligan. The evidence was provided by\n\ndeposition before trial, and during trial, as witnesses testified as to the events\n\nsurrounding Mulligan’s arrest. A reasonable juror could find that Officer O’Daniel\n\nand Officer Kapanski violated Mulligan’s clearly established Fourth Amendment\n\nrights; consequently, the trial court did not err by denying Baker’s motion for\n\ndirected verdict and motion for summary judgment upon qualified immunity. See\n\nPearson, 555 U.S. at 232.\n\n                             V. BATSON VIOLATION\n\n             Baker next argues that the trial court committed error by concluding\n\nthat Baker’s use of a peremptory strike seeking to remove prospective Juror 15\n\nviolated Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). Baker points out that he\n\nexercised peremptory strikes as to Juror 15 and Juror 18; thereafter, Mulligan\n\nchallenged the use of the peremptory strikes as to these two Jurors. According to\n\nBaker, he then offered race neutral reasons for the peremptory strikes. As to Juror\n\n15, Baker states that he informed the court that he struck this juror because the\n\n“juror worked in HR and would be addressing complaints and would be ‘use[] to\n\nhandling claims.’” Baker’s Brief at 30. As to Juror 18, Baker states that he\n\ninformed the trial court that he struck this juror because her son had interactions\n\nwith police. Baker argues that the trial court then improperly ruled that Baker’s\n\nuse of a peremptory strike upon Juror 15 violated Batson, 476 U.S. 79. Baker\n\n\n                                          -34-\n\fmaintains that the trial court erroneously placed the burden on him to prove a race\n\nneutral basis for striking Juror 15; however, the burden should have been placed\n\nupon Mulligan to prove prima facie that a racial reason existed for striking Juror\n\n15. And Baker asserts that “the trial court failed to render a ruling clear enough to\n\ndiscern, particularly with regards to step three of the Batson analysis” and that “the\n\ntrial court bypassed step 3 of the Batson analysis entirely.” Baker’s Combined\n\nResponse Brief at 42.\n\n              In Batson, 476 U.S. at 89, the United States Supreme Court held that\n\nthe use of peremptory strikes to remove prospective jurors from the venire upon\n\nthe basis of race offends the equal rights provision of the United States\n\nConstitution.10 To determine if the equal protection clause was violated, the court\n\nmust conduct a three-step analysis:\n\n              First, the [challenging party] must make a prima facie\n              showing that the [other party] has exercised\n              peremptory challenges on the basis of race. . . . Second,\n              if the requisite showing has been made, the burden shifts\n              to the [other party] to articulate a race-neutral\n              explanation for striking the jurors in question. . . .\n              Finally, the trial court must determine whether the\n              [challenging party] has carried his burden of proving\n              purposeful discrimination.\n\n\n\n\n10\n  It is well-established that the holding in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986) equally\napplies to civil actions. Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., Inc., 500 U.S. 614, 628 (1991).\n\n\n\n                                              -35-\n\fLouisville Metro Gov’t v. Ward, 610 S.W.3d 295, 309 (Ky. App. 2020) (quoting\n\nCommonwealth v. Snodgrass, 831 S.W.2d 176, 178 (Ky. 1992)). The trial court is\n\nin the best position to judge the motives behind a party’s use of a peremptory\n\nstrike; thus, the trial court’s decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly\n\nerroneous. Gray v. Commonwealth, 203 S.W.3d 679, 691 (Ky. 2006); Washington\n\nv. Commonwealth, 34 S.W.3d 376, 379-80 (Ky. 2000).\n\n             As previously discussed in Footnote 3, we were not provided with the\n\nvideo record evidencing the trial court’s ruling on Mulligan’s Batson challenge. In\n\nBaker’s brief, he cites to the video record at 11:10 a.m. on March 14, 2022, for the\n\ntime Mulligan made the Batson challenge and at 11:12 a.m. for the time the trial\n\ncourt rendered its ruling. We have carefully examined the video record. On\n\nMarch 14, 2022, at 11:10 a.m., Mulligan asked the court to approach the bench at\n\nwhich time the video stopped, and then at 11:17 a.m., the video resumes with the\n\ntrial court explaining to the jury that a mistake occurred in the numbering of jurors.\n\nThe trial court then instructed Juror 15 to replace Juror 14 on the jury. But, we\n\nhave no recording evidencing Mulligan’s precise Batson challenge or the trial\n\ncourt’s exact ruling on the Batson challenge. In the absence of a complete record\n\nfor appellate review, we must presume that the missing record supports the trial\n\ncourt’s decision. Haney v. Stykes, 688 S.W.3d 561, 565 (Ky. App. 2023). As a\n\n\n\n\n                                         -36-\n\fresult, we are unable to conclude that the trial court ruling on the Batson challenge\n\nwas clearly erroneous. See Gray, 203 S.W.3d at 691.\n\n                  VI. CHANGE OF VENUE/CONTINUANCE\n\n             Baker also argues that the trial court erred by failing to grant his\n\nmotion for a continuance and motion for a change of venue. Baker points out that\n\nthe trial herein occurred “in the immediate aftermath of the United States Justice\n\nDepartment (“DOJ”) issuing its findings regarding racial injustice on the part of\n\nthe Louisville Metro Police Department.” Baker’s Brief at 36. According to\n\nBaker, the Attorney General of the United States stated that “[t]he Justice\n\nDepartment has concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that Louisville\n\nMetro and LMPD engage in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the\n\nconstitutional rights of the residents of Louisville – including by using excessive\n\nforce [and] unlawfully discriminating against Black people.” Baker’s Brief at 36.\n\nBaker argues that the trial court should have either moved the trial to a different\n\ncounty or continued the trial until the news coverage abated. Baker asserts he was\n\nprejudiced by the trial court’s failure to grant his motions. Baker points to\n\ntestimony during trial by Mulligan that Baker was complicit in the justice system\n\nwhere widespread discrimination against African-Americans occured. Baker’s\n\nBrief at 37. Additionally, Baker cites to Mulligan’s testimony that if Baker had\n\n\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\fpublicized and pursued Mulligan’s case to his satisfaction, the ensuing scrutiny of\n\nthe LMPD might have prevented the death of Breonna Taylor.\n\n             In a civil action, KRS 452.010(2) provides that a party is entitled to a\n\nchange of venue:\n\n             [W]hen it appears that, because of the undue influence of\n             his or her adversary or the odium that attends the party\n             applying or his or her cause of action or defense, or\n             because of the circumstances or nature of the case he or\n             she cannot have a fair and impartial trial in the county.\n\nThe trial court’s decision on a motion for change of venue will be reviewed for an\n\nabuse of discretion. Arkk Properties, LLC v. Cameron, 681 S.W.3d 133, 141 (Ky.\n\n2023).\n\n             In response to Baker’s argument that a change of venue was\n\nwarranted, Mulligan points out that Baker questioned potential jurors and that no\n\nevidence exists that Baker did not have a fair and impartial trial in Jefferson\n\nCounty:\n\n             During voir dire, Baker asked the potential jurors about\n             black civilians and police interactions, the Black Lives\n             Matter movement, whether jurors believed “police are\n             being too mean, too rough,” or whether they would “be\n             in favor of black defendants or police officers, or\n             anything like that.” None of the venire indicated any\n             response to these prompts.\n\n                    Baker specifically brought up the [Department of\n             Justice] DOJ Report, telling the jury the Justice\n             Department released a report the previous week and\n             asked the jurors if anybody knew about the report. He\n\n                                         -38-\n\f               asked if this would affect any potential juror’s decision in\n               any way. There was no response from any potential juror\n               to this prompt. There was no evidence any of the jurors\n               were tainted by the DOJ Report, and no evidence it\n               would influence their decision making, and Baker has\n               never shown otherwise.\n\nMulligan’s Combined Brief at 44.\n\n               It appears that the trial court believed that a voir dire examination of\n\npotential jurors was sufficient to discover if the jurors were biased or prejudiced by\n\nnews coverage or by current events. And during voir dire, Baker questioned the\n\npotential jurors extensively to uncover potential prejudice or bias; however, no\n\njuror responded affirmatively to Baker’s questions. In the end, Baker has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a\n\nchange of venue or continuance.\n\n                    VII. EXCESSIVE DAMAGES\n         PAIN AND SUFFERING IN THE UNDERLYING ACTION\n\n               Baker argues that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a\n\nnew trial based upon the excessiveness of the jury’s award of damages in the\n\nunderlying action. Baker maintains that the jury’s damage award of $250,000 for\n\npain and suffering was the result of passion and prejudice. In support thereof,\n\nBaker cites to “cumulative inflammatory testimony and innuendo [that] was\n\nrendered on the hot-button issue of police abuse of African-Americans.” Baker’s\n\nBrief at 40.\n\n\n                                           -39-\n\f             Under CR 59.01(d), a new trial may be granted upon the basis of\n\nexcessive damages that appear to be the result of passion or prejudice. As an\n\nappellate court, our review is deferential to the trial court:\n\n             The amount of damages is a dispute left to the sound\n             discretion of the jury, and its determination should not be\n             set aside merely because we would have reached a\n             different conclusion. If the verdict bears any reasonable\n             relationship to the evidence of loss suffered, it is the duty\n             of the trial court and this Court not to disturb the jury’s\n             assessment of damages.\n\nHazelwood v. Beauchamp, 766 S.W.2d 439, 440 (Ky. App. 1989).\n\n             As we have reversed the jury’s award of $250,000 for Mulligan’s pain\n\nand suffering damages caused by Baker’s malpractice, there only remains the\n\njury’s award of $250,000 for Mulligan’s pain and suffering caused by Officer\n\nO’Daniel’s and Officer Kapanski’s conduct. Considering the evidence adduced at\n\ntrial, it is clear that the award of $250,000 in damages for pain and suffering in the\n\nunderlying action bears a reasonable relationship to the pain and suffering endured\n\nby Mulligan and was not the result of passion or prejudice. Mulligan testified\n\nextensively concerning the pain and suffering he endured as a result of Officer\n\nO’Daniel’s and Officer Kapanski’s use of excessive force and violation of\n\nMulligan’s civil rights on the night he was arrested and thereafter. The jury\n\ninstructions on this issue were sufficient. Consequently, we conclude that the trial\n\n\n\n\n                                          -40-\n\fcourt did not abuse its discretion by denying Baker’s motion for new trial for the\n\nexcessiveness of the jury’s award of damages in the underlying action.\n\n          VIII. DISQUALIFICATION OF MULLIGAN’S COUNSEL\n\n              Baker maintains that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to\n\ndisqualify Mulligan’s legal counsel. Baker argues that the trial court should have\n\ndisqualified both Hans Poppe and Kirk Laughlin as they might have been called as\n\na witness to testify at trial by Baker. Baker points out that the trial court ultimately\n\ndisqualified Laughlin but then permitted Laughlin to be seated near his colleagues\n\nduring trial. However, it is uncontroverted that Baker admittedly did not call either\n\nLaughlin or Poppe as a witness during trial. Given that Baker did not call either\n\nLaughlin or Poppe as witnesses at trial, any error is harmless.11\n\n                IX. DIRECTED VERDICT INDEMNIFICATION/\n                          THIRD PARTY CLAIM\n\n              Baker asserts that the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict\n\non his indemnification and third-party claims against Laughlin and the Poppe Law\n\nFirm. In his appellant’s brief, Baker’s entire argument consists of only five\n\nsentences, and he cites no legal authority therein. Baker’s Brief at 39. Baker’s\n\nargument plainly lacks supportive factual detail and sufficient legal analysis.\n\n\n11\n  When seeking review of a trial court’s ruling on a motion to disqualify legal counsel, the\nprimary method is to file a writ of prohibition/mandamus. See Marcum v. Scorsone, 457 S.W.3d\n710, 716-17 (Ky. 2015); Commonwealth v. Maricle, 10 S.W.3d 117, 120-22 (Ky. 1999).\n\n\n\n                                           -41-\n\fSimply put, Baker’s argument is cursory and perfunctory. It is not the function of\n\nthis Court to research, construct, or articulate a party’s arguments on appeal.\n\nHarris v. Commonwealth, 384 S.W.3d 117, 131 (Ky. 2012) (citing Doherty v. City\n\nof Chicago, 75 F.3d 318, 324 (7th Cir. 1996)).12 We, thus, perceive no error.\n\n                We view any remaining contentions of error in Baker’s direct appeal\n\nto be moot or without merit.\n\n                      CROSS-APPEAL NO. 2023-CA-0740-MR\n\n              Mulligan alleges that the trial court erroneously granted a directed\n\nverdict upon his claim for punitive damages. Mulligan believes that he was\n\nentitled to have the jury instructed upon punitive damages based upon Baker’s\n\nconduct. Mulligan argues that punitive damages are proper because Baker was\n\ngrossly negligent in his representation of Mulligan. When viewing the evidence\n\nmost favorable to him, Mulligan maintains that a reasonable juror could have\n\nfound that Baker was grossly negligent and that he was entitled to an award of\n\npunitive damages. Mulligan cites to evidence adduced at trial, which included that\n\nBaker withdrew from representing Mulligan in the underlying action; that Baker\n\nfailed to research the applicable statute of limitations which led to the dismissal of\n\n\n12\n   In the notice of appeal filed in this case, Kirk Laughlin and the Poppe Law Firm were named\nappellees, based on the directed verdict of Baker’s third-party claim. However, neither party\nfiled an appellee brief as required by the Kentucky Rules of Appellate Procedure (RAP) 30 and\n32. Notwithstanding, they improperly addressed this issue in Mulligan’s appellee brief at page\n45-47. Given Baker’s failure to articulate a valid argument on appeal, we have declined to\nimpose sanctions permitted under RAP 31(H)(3).\n\n                                             -42-\n\fall claims except one in federal court; that Baker failed to name Officer Kapanski\n\nin the complaint; that Baker failed to hire any expert witness; and that Baker failed\n\nto take any depositions in the underlying action.\n\n             The Kentucky Supreme Court has recognized that punitive damages\n\nmay be recovered in a legal malpractice action when the damages are based upon\n\nthe attorney’s conduct. Osborne, 399 S.W.3d at 22-23. To recover punitive\n\ndamages, it must be demonstrated that “the attorney was grossly negligent in\n\nhandling the case and acted with oppression, fraud, or malice.” Id. at 23; see also\n\nKRS 411.184(2). And a directed verdict is proper only if “there is a complete\n\nabsence of proof on a material issue or if no disputed issues of fact exist upon\n\nwhich reasonable minds could differ.” Jewish Hosp. & St. Mary’s Healthcare, Inc.\n\nv. House, 563 S.W.3d 626, 630 (Ky. 2018) (quoting Argotte v. Harrington, 521\n\nS.W.3d 550, 554 (Ky. 2017)).\n\n             During trial, there was certainly an abundance of evidence showing\n\nthat Baker’s representation of Mulligan was negligent in the underlying action.\n\nBaker admitted that he mistakenly allowed the statute of limitations to expire on all\n\nbut one of Mulligan’s claims. Moreover, there was evidence that Baker also may\n\nhave been negligent in other aspects of his representation of Mulligan in the\n\nunderlying civil action. Nevertheless, we are unable to conclude that the evidence\n\nalso demonstrated gross negligence, fraud, oppression, or malice committed by\n\n\n                                        -43-\n\fBaker. To the contrary, there is insufficient evidence to support this argument. In\n\nthis respect, we are of the opinion that the trial court properly directed a verdict\n\nupon Mulligan’s claim for punitive damages.\n\n                                     SUMMARY\n\n             In Appeal No. 2023-CA-0707-MR, we reverse the March 21, 2023,\n\nJudgment as to the award of $250,000 for pain and suffering based upon Baker’s\n\nmalpractice conduct but affirm the award of $250,000 for pain and suffering\n\nendured by Mulligan as the result of the conduct of LMPD officers as asserted in\n\nthe underlying action, to which Mulligan was entitled but for Baker’s negligence.\n\nWe also affirm on all other grounds raised by Baker in his direct appeal and by\n\nMulligan in Cross-Appeal No. 2023-CA-0740-MR.\n\n             ALL CONCUR.\n\n BRIEFS FOR APPELLANT/CROSS-                BRIEFS FOR APPELLEE/CROSS-\n APPELLEE:                                  APPELLANT:\n\n Kenneth H.

The civil rights action, hereinafter referred to as the underlying action,\n\nwas dismissed by the United States District Court for the Western District of\n\nKentucky as being time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Thus, to\n\nascertain damages against Baker, the underlying action was recreated in the legal\n\nmalpractice action in what is referred to as a “suit-within-a-suit.” Osborne v.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fKeeney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5113201\"><a href=\"/opinion/5284892/osborne-v-keeney/#10\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Osborne v.

Mulligan was an adult dancer and was\n\npreparing to work in a local establishment on Main Street. Mulligan was outside\n\nthe establishment when he observed a motor vehicle speeding past him; thereupon,\n\nMulligan yelled and motioned with his hand for the vehicle to slow down. The\n\nmotor vehicle then backed up on the one-way street, and Louisville Metro Police\n\nOfficer Timothy O’Daniel emerged from the vehicle.\n\n            The events that happened next are disputed. However, Mulligan\n\ntestified that Officer O’Daniel instructed Mulligan to approach him and then\n\ninstructed Mulligan to place his hands on the Officer’s motor vehicle. Mulligan\n\nstated that he complied with all directives of Officer O’Daniel. Nonetheless,\n\nMulligan recounted that Officer O’Daniel proceeded to place a handcuff on one of\n\nhis hands and told him that he was under arrest for public intoxication. Mulligan\n\ntestified that he told Officer O’Daniel that he had not committed a crime and had\n\nnot been drinking; thereupon, Officer O’Daniel thrust Mulligan to the ground\n\npenning Mulligan’s arm beneath him. Mulligan further testified that Officer\n\nO’Daniel placed his knees in his back and neck and beat him with his fists.\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fEventually, Mulligan stated that he was placed into a police vehicle where Officer\n\nO’Daniel again beats him for saying that they were punk ass police, and another\n\nmember of LMPD, Officer Wayne Kapanski,1 begins twisting Mulligan’s neck.\n\nMulligan testified that he eventually played dead, so Officer O’Daniel and Officer\n\nKapanski would stop assaulting him.\n\n              By contrast, Officer O’Daniel testified that he was driving in a marked\n\npolice vehicle on Main Street in downtown Louisville, Kentucky, when Mulligan\n\nyelled at him. Officer O’Daniel then stated that he backed up his police vehicle to\n\ninvestigate. Officer O’Daniel could not recall how they started interacting but\n\nremembered that Mulligan came to his police vehicle. Officer O’Daniel then\n\ntestified that Mulligan appeared intoxicated by the way he was walking and that he\n\nsmelled of alcohol. Officer O’Daniel stated that he believed Mulligan was under\n\nthe influence of alcohol and told Mulligan he was being arrested for public\n\nintoxication. Officer O’Daniel testified that when he attempted to hand cuff\n\nMulligan, Mulligan squared up or reared back, and he was only able to place one\n\nhand cuff on Mulligan. At that point, Officer O’Daniel stated that he believed\n\nMulligan was actively resisting arrest. Eventually, Officer O’Daniel testified that\n\nhe and Mulligan ended upon the ground with Officer O’Daniel attempting to gain\n\n\n1\n  Officer Wayne Kapanski’s last name is sometimes spelled Kopanski. Throughout this Opinion,\nwe shall spell his last name as Kapanski as the circuit court did in its jury instructions and\njudgment.\n\n                                             -4-\n\fcontrol over Mulligan. According to Officer O’Daniel, he called for backup;\n\nMulligan was successfully restrained, and Mulligan was placed in the backseat of a\n\npolice vehicle. Officer O’Daniel charged Mulligan with public intoxication,\n\ndisorderly conduct, resisting arrest, menacing, and assault.\n\n              Mulligan engaged Baker to represent him in the criminal action, and\n\nthe circuit court eventually dismissed all criminal charges against Mulligan without\n\na probable cause stipulation. Mulligan then engaged Baker to represent him in a\n\ncivil action seeking damages from the officers and/or Louisville-Jefferson County\n\nMetro Government.\n\n              On April 24, 2014, Mulligan filed a complaint in the Jefferson Circuit\n\nCourt against Officer O’Daniel and Louisville-Jefferson County Metro\n\nGovernment for unlawful search and seizure, false arrest, use of excessive force,\n\nmalicious prosecution, and for violations of 42 United States Code (U.S.C.) §§\n\n1983, 1985, &amp; 1986 (Mulligan v. O’Daniel, Action No. 14-CI-002286). The\n\naction was removed to the United States District Court, Western District of\n\nKentucky, Louisville Division (Mulligan v. O’Daniel, Civil Action No. 3:14-CV-\n\n00393-JHM).2 By summary judgment entered October 27, 2015, the U.S. District\n\n\n\n2\n For clarity in this Opinion, the civil action filed by Kenneth H. Baker on behalf of Andre\nMulligan for claims arising from actions of police officers of the Louisville Metro Police\nDepartment (LMPD), will be referred to throughout as the “underlying action.” The action filed\nagainst Baker by Mulligan will be referred to as the “malpractice” action.\n\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fCourt dismissed all claims based upon expiration of the one-year statute of\n\nlimitations, except the malicious prosecution claim. The U.S. District Court\n\nconcluded that the dismissed claims were not timely filed as the complaint was\n\nfiled (April 24, 2014) more than one year from Mulligan’s arrest (September 2,\n\n2012).3\n\n              Baker subsequently informed Mulligan that he may have committed\n\nmalpractice by failing to timely file the underlying action. Thereafter, Mulligan\n\nengaged attorney Kirk Laughlin from the Poppe Law Firm to represent him in a\n\npotential malpractice action against Baker. By letter dated June 28, 2016, Laughlin\n\ninformed Baker that Mulligan had retained Laughlin in relation to a possible\n\nmalpractice claim and requested a copy of Mulligan’s file. Baker then sent an\n\nemail to Mulligan and informed him that Baker could not continue to represent him\n\nin the U.S. District Court. The court permitted Baker to withdraw from\n\nrepresenting Mulligan in the action and gave Mulligan time to secure new legal\n\ncounsel. Nonetheless, Mulligan failed to secure legal counsel to represent him, and\n\nthe U.S. District Court dismissed the malicious prosecution claim for failure to\n\nprosecute on November 17, 2016.\n\n\n\n\n3\n The U.S. District Court concluded that § 1983 actions in Kentucky were limited by the one-\nyear statute of limitations found in Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 413.140(1)(a) and that\nMulligan’s state law claims were also barred by KRS 413.140(1)(a) and (1)(d).\n\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\f            Mulligan then filed the instant legal malpractice action against Baker\n\nin June of 2017. Baker timely answered the complaint. Baker later filed a third-\n\nparty complaint against Laughlin and the Poppe Law Firm. In the third-party\n\ncomplaint, Baker alleged:\n\n                  3. That, on or before June 24, 2016, the Plaintiff,\n            Andre Mulligan, hired the Defendant, Kirk A. Laughlin\n            and the Poppe Law Firm, to represent him for alleged\n            legal malpractice related to the underlying claim\n            Mulligan v. O’Daniel, in the U.S. District Court for the\n            Western District of Kentucky, Case No. 3:14-cv-00393.\n\n                  4. That the Plaintiff, Andre Mulligan, had\n            contracted with Defendant Baker to represent him in the\n            underlying claim, and in so contracting had agreed to\n            cooperate with Baker in regards to the underlying claim.\n\n                   ....\n\n                   7. That Defendant Baker had secured a settlement\n            offer in the underlying matter and that, upon the advice\n            and intentional interference of the Third Party\n            Defendants, the Plaintiff refused any cooperation with\n            Defendant Baker to facilitate the settlement of the\n            underlying matter.\n\n                  8. That the Plaintiff refused any cooperation or\n            communication with Defendant Baker, forcing Baker to\n            withdraw from the underlying matter and breaching the\n            contract between Baker and the Plaintiff.\n\n                   9. That the U.S. District Court advised Plaintiff\n            and Third Party Defendants of Defendant Baker’s request\n            to withdraw from the underlying claim on or about July\n            13, 2016, and subsequent thereto, and as to the necessity\n            for a subsequent attorney to enter an appearance in the\n            matter.\n\n                                        -7-\n\f                    10. That, despite the Court’s notice to the Third\n             Party Defendants, Laughlin and the Poppe Law Firm,\n             failed to represent Plaintiff in the underlying matter,\n             failed to advise Plaintiff of the need for him to secure an\n             attorney, and failed to advise him of the necessity to\n             mitigate any damages related to any alleged malpractice.\n\n                    11. That, as a result of the negligence of the Third\n             Party Defendants, Laughlin and the Poppe Law Firm, the\n             Plaintiff’s claim for malicious prosecution in Case No.\n             3:14-cv-00393 was dismissed on November 17, 2016.\n\n                    12. That, as a result of the contractual interference\n             of the Third Party Defendants, Baker suffered damages,\n             including the loss of attorney fees in settling or litigating\n             the underlying action.\n\n                    13. The Third Party Defendants failed to exercise\n             that degree of care and skill expected of reasonably\n             competent attorneys while representing Plaintiff,\n             resulting in significant financial loss and dismissal of\n             Plaintiff’s claim of malicious prosecution against Officer\n             O’Daniel. Such failure was negligent and/or grossly\n             negligent.\n\nThird-Party Complaint at 2-3.\n\n             A jury trial ensued on March 13, 2023, in Jefferson Circuit Court that\n\nlasted for five days. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of Laughlin and\n\nPoppe Law Firm upon Baker’s third-party claims, but Mulligan’s claims as\n\nasserted in the complaint were presented to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in\n\nfavor of Mulligan and found that Baker had committed malpractice. The jury\n\nawarded Mulligan damages of $250,000 for pain and suffering caused by Officer\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fO’Daniel’s and Officer Kapanski’s conduct in the underlying action and also\n\nawarded additional damages of $250,000 in pain and suffering caused by Baker’s\n\nmalpractice. As a result, the trial court rendered a Judgment on March 21, 2023,\n\nagainst Baker for a total of $500,000.\n\n              Baker filed Appeal No. 2023-CA-0707-MR and Mulligan filed Cross-\n\nAppeal No. 2023-CA-0740-MR. We shall initially address the arguments raised in\n\nAppeal No. 2023-CA-0707-MR and then Cross-Appeal No. 2023-CA-0740-MR.\n\n                           APPEAL NO. 2023-CA-0707-MR\n\n              To begin, Baker raises numerous issues on appeal. For purposes of\n\nfacilitating our review, we have categorically grouped the issues by subject matter\n\nto provide a cogent and orderly analysis which follows.\n\n                              I. EVIDENTARY RULINGS\n\n              As an appellate court, we review the trial court’s evidentiary rulings\n\nfor an abuse of discretion. Ky. Guardianship Adm’rs, LLC v.

Nose Fracture\n\n               Baker contends the trial court committed reversible error by\n\npermitting Mulligan to testify that he suffered a broken nose from being hit in the\n\nface by Officer O’Daniel. Baker points out that during trial, Mulligan testified that\n\nhis nose had been broken in a motor vehicle accident several months before his\n\narrest, had healed, and was broken again by Officer O’Daniel on the night of his\n\narrest. Baker believes that only a medical expert could testify concerning\n\nMulligan’s nose fracture. Baker also asserts that Mulligan was improperly\n\npermitted to refer to emergency room records during his direct examination. In\n\nfact, Baker alleges that Mulligan improperly read from the emergency room record\n\nduring his testimony.\n\n               During direct examination, Mulligan was asked to identify a photo of\n\nhim taken at the jail. Counsel then inquired what was different about this photo of\n\nhim. Mulligan responded that his nose was visibly slanted and that his nose was\n\nbroken. Mulligan pointed out that he knew his nose was broken by how slanted his\n\n\n\ntheir objections were not preserved. Neither party raised this issue before the trial court nor this\nCourt. Accordingly, we have relied on the parties’ arguments as set out in their briefs in our\nreview of these issues.\n\n                                                -10-\n\fnose was to one side. Mulligan also acknowledged that his nose was previously\n\nbroken in a car accident but that his nose was straight then. Mulligan also\n\ndescribed other injuries that were visible on the photo. Mulligan further testified\n\nthat upon being released from jail the next day, he went to the emergency room at\n\nSaint Mary’s Hospital. During his direct examination, Mulligan referred to records\n\nfrom the emergency room. He testified that he saw an emergency room doctor and\n\nhad multiple radiology tests. Reading from the emergency room records, Mulligan\n\nindicated that he was diagnosed with a left nasal bone fracture, among other\n\ninjuries. Mulligan stated that his nose was broken due to Officer O’Daniel\n\nrepeatedly striking Mulligan’s face.\n\n             In the Kentucky Rules of Evidence, two separate sections control the\n\nadmission of lay opinion evidence and expert opinion evidence. KRE 701 deals\n\nwith lay opinion evidence, and it provides:\n\n             If the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness’\n             testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited\n             to those opinions or inferences which are:\n\n             (a) Rationally based on the perception of the witness;\n\n             (b) Helpful to a clear understanding of the witness’\n             testimony or the determination of a fact in issue; and\n\n             (c) Not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized\n             knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\n\nAnd KRE 702 deals with expert opinion evidence, and it provides:\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f            If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\n            will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or\n            to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an\n            expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or\n            education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion\n            or otherwise, if the proponent demonstrates to the court\n            that it is more likely than not that:\n\n            (1) The testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data;\n\n            (2) The testimony is the product of reliable principles and\n            methods; and\n\n            (3) The witness’ opinion reflects a reliable application of\n            the principles and methods to the facts of the case.\n\nAs an addendum to KRE 701, the notes of the Evidence Rules Review\n\nCommission explain:\n\n                   The amendments to Rules 701 and 702 must be\n            read together. The introduction and reliability of the\n            evidence is determined not by asking whether\n            the witness is lay or expert, but, instead, by asking\n            whether the testimony to be offered is lay or “scientific,\n            technical, or other specialized knowledge.” If it is of the\n            former, then Rule 701 is applicable. If it is of the latter,\n            then Rule 702 must be used.\n\nUnder KRE 701, a lay person is permitted to testify as to an apparent physical or\n\nbodily condition that is based upon his own first-hand perceptions and not based\n\nupon medical expertise.

The emergency room records from Saint\n\nMary’s Hospital were self-authenticating, and the records’ contents qualify under\n\nan exception to the hearsay rule. Kentucky Revised Statutes (KRS) 422.300(2);\n\nKRE 803(6). So, Mulligan testified as to his lay opinion that he suffered from a\n\nbroken nose based upon his first-hand observations of his nose per KRE 701. Even\n\nif such lay opinion evidence were improper, Mulligan also read from the\n\nemergency room records entered into the record, wherein, he was diagnosed as\n\nsuffering a broken nose. As a result, we are unable to conclude that reversible\n\nerror occurred.\n\nB. Workers’ Compensation Opinion\n\n              Baker contends that the trial court committed reversible error by\n\nexcluding evidence that Mulligan had allegedly committed perjury during a\n\nworkers’ compensation proceeding.5 Baker states that Mulligan filed a workers’\n\ncompensation action approximately five years before his arrest. Baker asserts that\n\nin the opinion, the administrative law judge opined that Mulligan had committed\n\n\n\n5\n Baker entered the opinion into the record by offering it as an avowal exhibit. Kentucky Rules\nof Evidence 103(a)(2).\n\n                                             -13-\n\fperjury in the proceedings. Baker argues that this evidence of perjury was relevant\n\nfor impeachment purposes. Baker also believes that Mulligan opened the door to\n\nsuch impeachment when he testified that, “I’m never going to lie. I’m not lying.\n\nI’ll go to jail before I lie.” Baker’s Brief at 12. Baker argues that the opinion in\n\nthe workers’ compensation case should have been admitted, and the trial court\n\ncommitted reversible error by failing to do so.\n\n             KRE 611(b) provides that “[a] witness may be cross-examined on any\n\nmatter relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility.” KRE 608 deals\n\nparticularly with the evidence admissible to support a witness’s credibility or to\n\nimpugn same. KRE 608 provides:\n\n             (a) Opinion and reputation evidence of character. The\n               credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by\n               evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but\n               subject to these limitations: (1) the evidence may refer\n               only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and\n               (2) evidence of truthful character is admissible only\n               after the character of the witness for truthfulness has\n               been attacked by opinion or reputation evidence or\n               otherwise.\n\n             (b) Specific instances of conduct. Specific instances of\n               the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or\n               supporting the witness’ credibility, other than\n               conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, may not\n               be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however,\n               in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness\n               or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination\n               of the witness: (1) concerning the witness’ character\n               for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or (2) concerning the\n               character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of another\n\n                                         -14-\n\f               witness as to which character the witness being cross-\n               examined has testified. No specific instance of conduct\n               of a witness may be the subject of inquiry under this\n               provision unless the cross-examiner has a factual basis\n               for the subject matter of his inquiry.\n\n             The giving of testimony, whether by an accused or by\n             any other witness, does not operate as a waiver of the\n             accused’s or the witness’ privilege against self-\n             incrimination when examined with respect to matters\n             which relate only to credibility.\n\n             At the discretion of the trial court, KRE 608(b) permits the cross-\n\nexamination of a witness concerning specific instances of past conduct that bear\n\nupon the truthfulness/untruthfulness of such witness; however, these specific\n\ninstances of conduct, other than criminal convictions, may not be proven by\n\nextrinsic evidence. See R. Lawson, The Kentucky Evidence Law Handbook, §\n\n4.25[4] (2019 Edition). Thus, counsel may ask a witness about such specific\n\ninstances of conduct but then “is stuck with whatever answer is given.” Allen v.\n\nCommonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"5112908\"><a href=\"/opinion/5284617/allen-v-commonwealth/#462\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Allen v. Commonwealth\">395 S.W.3d 451, 462</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ky. 2013). And it must be emphasized that\n\nthe decision to admit or exclude such an instance of past conduct is within the\n\ndiscretion of the trial court. KRE 608.\n\n             In this case, KRE 608 would allow the trial court, at its discretion, to\n\npermit Baker to cross-examine Mulligan about his alleged perjury in the workers’\n\ncompensation action. However, Baker would not have been permitted to introduce\n\nthe opinion into evidence. In this instance, the trial court exercised its discretion\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fand declined to permit the cross-examination or introduction of the opinion into\n\nevidence. Baker has failed to demonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion\n\nby so doing.\n\n               The Kentucky Supreme Court has recognized that “when one party\n\nintroduces improper evidence, such ‘opens the door’ for the other party to\n\nintroduce improper evidence in rebuttal whose only claim to admission is that it\n\nexplains or rebuts the prior inadmissible evidence.” Metcalf v. Commonwealth,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9597632\"><a href=\"/opinion/1355360/metcalf-v-commonwealth/#746\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Metcalf v. Commonwealth\">158 S.W.3d 740, 746</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ky. 2005). While Mulligan did testify as to his truthfulness,\n\nthe trial court believed that introduction of the alleged perjury in the workers’\n\ncompensation proceeding would lead to undue prejudice. Under KRE 403, the\n\ntrial court may exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by undue\n\nprejudice. Here, the trial court particularly determined that the prejudicial effect of\n\nthe alleged perjury in the workers’ compensation action outweighed its probative\n\nvalue, and we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by so ruling.\n\nC. Underlying Damage Claims\n\n               Baker contends that the trial court committed reversible error by\n\nexcluding evidence related to Mulligan’s claim of damages against the police\n\nofficers for unlawful search and seizure, false arrest, use of excessive force,\n\nmalicious prosecution, and for violations of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">42 U.S.C. §§ 1983</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1985, and 1986. In\n\nparticular, Baker alleges that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence of\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f“Mulligan’s past, present, or future income or financial status.” Baker’s Brief at\n\n13. Baker points out that Mulligan testified that he suffered loss of reputation and\n\nloss of income due to his alleged false arrest. During discovery in the underlying\n\naction, Baker alleges that Mulligan’s tax documents demonstrate that he was being\n\nuntruthful concerning his financial losses, and such untruthfulness led to a\n\nbreakdown of the attorney-client relationship. Moreover, Baker believes that the\n\ntax documents were admissible under KRE 608(b).\n\n             As set forth above, KRE 608 permits the cross-examination of a\n\nwitness concerning specific instances of past conduct that bear upon the\n\ntruthfulness/untruthfulness of such witness; however, these specific instances of\n\nconduct, other than criminal convictions, may not be proven by extrinsic evidence.\n\nAnd the decision to admit or exclude such a specific instance of past conduct lies\n\nwithin the discretion of the trial court.\n\n             In this case, the trial court exercised its discretion under KRE 608 and\n\nexcluded such evidence of Mulligan’s finances. Additionally, it must be\n\nremembered that Mulligan did not seek to recover any damages for lost income or\n\nloss of reputation in the community. Rather, Mulligan only sought damages for\n\npain and suffering caused by the officers’ actions and for pain and suffering caused\n\nby Baker as a result of his malpractice. Therefore, Mulligan’s financial losses or\n\n\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\fgains were simply irrelevant to any damage claim. Upon the whole, we do not\n\nbelieve that the trial court abused its discretion by excluding this evidence.\n\nD. Evidence of Prior Assault of Mulligan by LMPD\n\n              Baker also contends that the trial court erred by excluding evidence of\n\na prior assault allegedly carried out by off-duty LMPD officers upon Mulligan in\n\nAugust of 2012, during an incident that occurred at Fourth Street Live in\n\nLouisville, Kentucky.6 Baker asserts that Mulligan had alleged that one off-duty\n\nLMPD officer put a gun to his head and told him to leave the venue. Thereafter,\n\nBaker points out that Mulligan filed a civil action, which was ultimately settled.\n\nBaker believes that evidence of this incident was relevant to Mulligan’s state of\n\nmind at the time of his arrest by Officer O’Daniel some two weeks later and upon\n\nMulligan’s damage claims.\n\n              In August of 2012, Mulligan was at Fourth Street Live when an\n\nincident occurred between him and one or more off-duty LMPD officers working\n\nas security. The August of 2012 incident did not involve physical injuries and did\n\nnot result in Mulligan’s arrest. Even if relevant, the probative value of the incident\n\nis weak at best; however, this slight probative value is substantially outweighed by\n\nits prejudicial effect on the jury. KRE 403. For this reason, we must conclude that\n\n\n\n6\n The off-duty police officers were employed by a private company providing security for Fourth\nStreet Live businesses.\n\n                                            -18-\n\fthe trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding evidence of the August of\n\n2012 incident.\n\n                                   II. MISTRIAL\n\n             Baker also asserts that the trial court erred by denying his motion for a\n\nmistrial. Baker argues that he was entitled to a mistrial due to “ambush testimony\n\nby Mulligan regarding an undisclosed surgery” to repair his alleged broken nose.\n\nBaker’s Brief at 11. More specifically, Baker contends that Mulligan improperly\n\ntestified that he had surgery to repair his broken nose because the bones were\n\ncrushed, and the surgery was necessary to save his life. However, Baker points out\n\nthat he was never informed about the nose surgery and argues the introduction of\n\nsuch evidence constitutes trial by ambush.\n\n             As to a mistrial, the Kentucky Supreme Court has held:\n\n                    It is universally agreed that a mistrial is an extreme\n             remedy and should be resorted to only when there is a\n             fundamental defect in the proceedings which will result\n             in a manifest injustice. The occurrence complained of\n             must be of such character and magnitude that a litigant\n             will be denied a fair and impartial trial and the prejudicial\n             effect can be removed in no other way.\n\nGould v. Charlton Co., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9653047\"><a href=\"/opinion/1564593/gould-v-charlton-co-inc/#738\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Gould v. Charlton Co., Inc.\">929 S.W.2d 734, 738</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ky. 1996).\n\n             In this case, we do not believe that Mulligan’s testimony concerning a\n\nsurgery on his nose to repair a fracture was sufficiently egregious to justify a\n\nmistrial. Baker was cross-examining Mulligan when Mulligan stated he had\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fundergone nose surgery, and Baker then continued to question Mulligan about the\n\nnose surgery. At that time, Baker made no objection to Mulligan’s testimony\n\nconcerning the nose surgery. In fact, Baker only objected to Mulligan’s testimony\n\nthe day after it occurred and at that time requested the mistrial. To be entitled to a\n\nmistrial, there must occur during trial a “fundamental defect,” and it “must be of\n\nsuch character and magnitude that a litigant will be denied a fair and impartial trial\n\nand the prejudicial effect can be removed in no other way.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9653047\"><a href=\"/opinion/1564593/gould-v-charlton-co-inc/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Gould v.

A properly\n\npreserved objection to the substance of a jury instruction presents an issue of law,\n\nand our review is de novo. Disselkamp, 600 S.W.3d at 709.\n\nA. Instruction No. 1 – Causation\n\n             In Instruction No. 1, Baker points out that the jury was initially\n\ninstructed to find whether he committed legal malpractice, and then in Instruction\n\nNo. 2, the jury was instructed upon the underlying claims of unlawful search and\n\nseizure, false arrest, use of excessive force, and malicious prosecution in relation to\n\nOfficer O’Daniel and/or Officer Kapanski. Baker maintains that the order of the\n\njury instructions was incorrect as the jury must initially be instructed on the\n\nunderlying claims, and if those claims are successful, the jury then proceeds to the\n\nlegal malpractice instruction. By reversing the order of the jury instructions, Baker\n\nbelieves that the jury findings as to causation were fatally flawed.\n\n             Baker filed proposed jury instructions wherein the jury was initially\n\ninstructed upon the underlying claims and thereafter instructed upon the legal\n\nmalpractice. Thus, this issue was preserved for appellate review.\n\n             In a legal malpractice action, it is well-established that:\n\n             [A] plaintiff . . . has the burden of proving: “[(]1) that\n             there was an employment relationship with the\n             defendant/attorney; [(]2) that the attorney neglected his\n             duty to exercise the ordinary care of a reasonably\n             competent attorney acting in the same or similar\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\f             circumstances; and (3) that the attorney’s negligence was\n             the proximate cause of damage to the client.”\n\nOsborne v.

Considering the jury instructions as a whole, we cannot\n\nconclude that the mere sequence of the jury instructions in this case resulted in\n\nprejudicial error. Disselkamp, 600 S.W.3d at 724.\n\nB. Instruction No. 1 – Duty of Mulligan\n\n             Baker also contends that jury Instruction No. 1 failed to set forth\n\nMulligan’s duties to peacefully submit to arrest, to exercise ordinary care for his\n\nown safety, and to obey law enforcement orders. Baker tendered jury instructions\n\nthat included these duties; thus, this issue is preserved for our review. Baker\n\nfurther alleges that such duties should have been included in the jury instructions\n\nfor false arrest and excessive force. We disagree.\n\n             As concerns excessive force, the jury was instructed in Instruction No.\n\n2, to find whether Officer O’Daniel and/or Officer Kapanski used unreasonable\n\nforce against Mulligan, and unreasonable force was defined as that force which is\n\nunreasonable under the circumstances. In determining whether unreasonable force\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fwas used, the jury was instructed to consider whether Mulligan was actively\n\nresisting arrest or attempting to flee arrest. So, the jury was instructed to consider\n\nMulligan’s conduct within the context of resisting arrest or attempting to flee. The\n\njury instructions upon excessive force fairly and accurately stated the law and\n\ncomplied with the bare bones approach for jury instructions in Kentucky.

Instruction No. 2 – Unlawful Search and Seizure, False Arrest, Use of\nExcessive Force, and Malicious Prosecution\n\n             In Instruction No. 2, Baker maintains that the trial court erred by\n\ncombining the claims of unlawful search and seizure, false arrest, use of excessive\n\n                                         -25-\n\fforce, and malicious prosecution into one jury instruction (Instruction No. 2).\n\nBaker alleges that Instruction No. 2 was ambiguous and confusing. Baker\n\ncomplains that Instruction No. 2 contained broad concepts and was modeled after\n\nfederal jury instructions.\n\n             Baker states that he preserved this error by submitting proposed jury\n\ninstructions that separated each claim, and we agree.\n\n             While the trial court did combine the underlying claims (unlawful\n\nsearch and seizure, false arrest, use of excessive force, and malicious prosecution)\n\ninto Instruction No. 2, the instruction clearly separated each claim and set forth the\n\nrelevant law applicable to such claim. The combining of the underlying claims of\n\nunlawful search and seizure, false arrest, use of excessive force, and malicious\n\nprosecution into one jury instruction is not per se erroneous. Rather, the jury\n\ninstruction must correctly state the law and do so in an intelligible manner. See\n\nMendez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2541407\"><a href=\"/opinion/2541407/mendez-v-university-of-kentucky-board-of-trustees/#538\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Mendez v. University of Kentucky Board of Trustees\">357 S.W.3d at 538-39</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Instruction No. 2 was plainly written, and the jury\n\nwas clearly instructed upon the law. Moreover, while Baker alleges the trial court\n\nerred by allegedly adopting federal jury instructions, Baker fails to specify how the\n\nadopted “federal” instructions were particularly erroneous.\n\nD. Instruction No. 2 – Terry Stop\n\n             Baker argues that the trial court misstated the law in Instruction No. 2\n\nby requiring Officer O’Daniel to possess probable cause to arrest Mulligan.\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\fAccording to Baker, Officer O’Daniel could have stopped Mulligan under Terry v.\n\nOhio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9423752\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Terry v.

Additionally, Baker argues that Instruction No. 2\n\nerroneously set forth the law as to Officer O’Daniel’s search of Mulligan and again\n\nargues that the search was justified under Terry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9423752\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Terry v.

Mulligan claims that\n\nthis issue is preserved by his proposed jury instructions.\n\n             However, a review of Baker’s proposed jury instructions reveal that\n\nBaker failed to offer an instruction consistent with Terry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9423752\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Terry v. Ohio\">392 U.S. 1</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In Baker’s\n\nproposed jury instructions, there is no instruction that Officer O’Daniel was\n\npermitted to stop and pat down Mulligan if he possessed a reasonable suspicion of\n\ncriminal activity. Baker stated that this objection was preserved by the filing of his\n\nproposed jury instructions. From a review of the proposed jury instructions, it is\n\nclear that the instructions do not fairly and adequately present Baker’s objection so\n\nas to preserve same for appellate review. Thus, this allegation of error is not\n\npreserved for our review.\n\nE. Instruction No. 2 – Officer O’Daniel and Officer Kapanski\n\n             Baker also assigns error in Instruction No. 2 as Officer O’Daniel and\n\nOfficer Kapanski were both included in some of the claims, and as a result, Baker\n\ncontends that it is impossible to discern the jury’s findings as to each officer:\n\n                    It cannot be deciphered from the trial court’s\n             Instruction whether the jury believed Mulligan met his\n\n                                         -27-\n\f             burden for liability against one or both of the officers.\n             As a result, the verdict does not support the burden of\n             proof being met against either officer. Here again, a\n             patchwork of findings on the part of the jury, none of\n             which 9 jurors agree upon, is easily possible. If Mulligan\n             convinced four jurors that Officer O’Daniel only was\n             liable, four others that Officer Kapanski was liable, and\n             the four remaining that both were liable, he should not be\n             entitled to a verdict. . . .\n\nBaker’s Brief at 23.\n\n             Instruction No. 2 was not erroneous for including both Officer\n\nKapanski and Officer O’Daniel. In Instruction No. 2, the jury unanimously agreed\n\nthat Mulligan “could have succeeded on at least one of his underlying civil rights\n\nclaims against Officer O’Daniel (false arrest, unlawful search, unlawful seizure, or\n\nmalicious prosecution) or Mr. Mulligan could have succeeded on his excessive\n\nforce claim against Officer O’Daniel and/or Officer Kapanski.” As to the\n\nagreement of jurors in a civil action, KRS 29A.280(3) provides, in relevant part,\n\n“[t]he agreement of at least three-fourths (3/4) of the jurors is required for a verdict\n\nin all civil trials by jury in Circuit Court.” Instruction No. 2 did not violate this\n\nstatutory requirement that nine jurors must agree for a verdict in a civil action. The\n\njury unanimously agreed upon Instruction No. 2, which included both Officer\n\nO’Daniel and Officer Kapanski. We, thus, reject Baker’s argument on this issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\fF. Instruction No. 4 – Damages\n\n               In Instruction No. 4, Baker contends that the trial court erred by\n\ninstructing the jury it could award damages for mental pain and suffering caused\n\nby his legal malpractice. Baker argues that damages for such emotional pain and\n\nsuffering are outside the scope of permissible damages in a legal negligence claim.\n\nBaker maintains that damages in a legal malpractice claim are limited to those\n\ndamages that could have been recovered in the underlying action. Additionally,\n\nBaker asserts that damages for emotional pain and suffering is limited to severe or\n\nserious emotional injuries that must be proven by expert testimony.

Based on our review of the facts of this case, the statute provides no\nadditional basis to award any damages against Baker, other than those damages Mulligan was\nentitled to in the underlying action.\n9\n  As will be discussed later in this Opinion, we affirm the damages awarded to Mulligan for pain\nand suffering based upon Officer Timothy O’Daniel’s and Officer Wayne Kapanski’s conduct in\nthe underlying action. However, we have reversed the award of damages for pain and suffering\nbased upon Baker’s malpractice in his representation of Mulligan in the underlying action.\n\n                                             -31-\n\f             As subsequently set forth in this Opinion, Baker’s third-party claims\n\nagainst the Poppe Law Firm were properly dismissed by directed verdict; thus, the\n\ntrial court correctly declined to instruct the jury to apportion liability to the law\n\nfirm. And as for Mulligan, Baker failed to introduce evidence that Mulligan was\n\nnegligent after Baker withdrew from the underlying action in federal court.\n\nTherefore, the trial court correctly declined to instruct the jury on apportionment.\n\n    IV. DENIAL OF DIRECTED VERDICT – QUALIFIED IMMUNITY\n\n             Baker contends that the trial court erred by denying his motion for\n\ndirected verdict as the claims against Officer O’Daniel and Officer Kapanski were\n\nbarred by qualified immunity. In particular, Baker argues:\n\n             [A]ll of Mulligan’s underlying claims should be barred\n             by Qualified Immunity, as would have been available\n             defense by Officer O’Daniel in the underlying litigation,\n             for a variety of reasons. Most critically, by Mulligan’s\n             various admissions in prior sworn testimony, judged\n             from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene\n             in September 2012, a reasonable jury could not find there\n             was not sufficient articulable suspicion for the initial stop\n             and probable cause for arrest for alcohol intoxication.\n             Furthermore, a police officer in similar circumstance’s\n             perspective, by Mulligan’s prior sworn testimony, would\n             interpret his actions as resisting arrest justifying an\n             application of minimal force. Despite Mulligan’s\n             description of the force used, application of minimal\n             force is the most reasonable [the] jury could believe\n             Mulligan credibly demonstrated.\n\n                    ....\n\n\n\n\n                                          -32-\n\f                    Given the extent, or lack thereof, of documented\n             injuries to Mulligan . . . , [Mulligan] cannot point to any\n             case that “clearly establishes” that it was a violation of\n             the law for an officer in September 2012 to use minimal\n             force, resulting in no injuries, using no weapons, to\n             effectuate a mandatory arrest on an intoxicated subject\n             actively resisting arrest. As a result, all of [Mulligan’s]\n             Fourth Amendment claims in the underlying action\n             would have been dismissed because of Qualified\n             Immunity.\n\nBaker’s Brief at 27-29.\n\n             As to claims alleging violations of the Fourth Amendment under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983</span><pre class=\"inline\">, an official may assert qualified immunity as a shield to such claims.\n\nBrowning v.

As to Juror\n\n15, Baker states that he informed the court that he struck this juror because the\n\n“juror worked in HR and would be addressing complaints and would be ‘use[] to\n\nhandling claims.’” Baker’s Brief at 30. As to Juror 18, Baker states that he\n\ninformed the trial court that he struck this juror because her son had interactions\n\nwith police.

Baker\n\n\n                                          -34-\n\fmaintains that the trial court erroneously placed the burden on him to prove a race\n\nneutral basis for striking Juror 15; however, the burden should have been placed\n\nupon Mulligan to prove prima facie that a racial reason existed for striking Juror\n\n15. And Baker asserts that “the trial court failed to render a ruling clear enough to\n\ndiscern, particularly with regards to step three of the Batson analysis” and that “the\n\ntrial court bypassed step 3 of the Batson analysis entirely.” Baker’s Combined\n\nResponse Brief at 42.\n\n              In Batson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9430491\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/#89\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Batson v.

CHANGE OF VENUE/CONTINUANCE\n\n             Baker also argues that the trial court erred by failing to grant his\n\nmotion for a continuance and motion for a change of venue. Baker points out that\n\nthe trial herein occurred “in the immediate aftermath of the United States Justice\n\nDepartment (“DOJ”) issuing its findings regarding racial injustice on the part of\n\nthe Louisville Metro Police Department.” Baker’s Brief at 36. According to\n\nBaker, the Attorney General of the United States stated that “[t]he Justice\n\nDepartment has concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that Louisville\n\nMetro and LMPD engage in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the\n\nconstitutional rights of the residents of Louisville – including by using excessive\n\nforce [and] unlawfully discriminating against Black people.” Baker’s Brief at 36.\n\nBaker argues that the trial court should have either moved the trial to a different\n\ncounty or continued the trial until the news coverage abated. Baker asserts he was\n\nprejudiced by the trial court’s failure to grant his motions. Baker points to\n\ntestimony during trial by Mulligan that Baker was complicit in the justice system\n\nwhere widespread discrimination against African-Americans occured. Baker’s\n\nBrief at 37. Additionally, Baker cites to Mulligan’s testimony that if Baker had\n\n\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\fpublicized and pursued Mulligan’s case to his satisfaction, the ensuing scrutiny of\n\nthe LMPD might have prevented the death of Breonna Taylor.\n\n             In a civil action, KRS 452.010(2) provides that a party is entitled to a\n\nchange of venue:\n\n             [W]hen it appears that, because of the undue influence of\n             his or her adversary or the odium that attends the party\n             applying or his or her cause of action or defense, or\n             because of the circumstances or nature of the case he or\n             she cannot have a fair and impartial trial in the county.\n\nThe trial court’s decision on a motion for change of venue will be reviewed for an\n\nabuse of discretion. Arkk Properties, LLC v. Cameron, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">681 S.W.3d 133</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 141 (Ky.\n\n2023).\n\n             In response to Baker’s argument that a change of venue was\n\nwarranted, Mulligan points out that Baker questioned potential jurors and that no\n\nevidence exists that Baker did not have a fair and impartial trial in Jefferson\n\nCounty:\n\n             During voir dire, Baker asked the potential jurors about\n             black civilians and police interactions, the Black Lives\n             Matter movement, whether jurors believed “police are\n             being too mean, too rough,” or whether they would “be\n             in favor of black defendants or police officers, or\n             anything like that.” None of the venire indicated any\n             response to these prompts.\n\n                    Baker specifically brought up the [Department of\n             Justice] DOJ Report, telling the jury the Justice\n             Department released a report the previous week and\n             asked the jurors if anybody knew about the report. He\n\n                                         -38-\n\f               asked if this would affect any potential juror’s decision in\n               any way. There was no response from any potential juror\n               to this prompt. There was no evidence any of the jurors\n               were tainted by the DOJ Report, and no evidence it\n               would influence their decision making, and Baker has\n               never shown otherwise.\n\nMulligan’s Combined Brief at 44.\n\n               It appears that the trial court believed that a voir dire examination of\n\npotential jurors was sufficient to discover if the jurors were biased or prejudiced by\n\nnews coverage or by current events. And during voir dire, Baker questioned the\n\npotential jurors extensively to uncover potential prejudice or bias; however, no\n\njuror responded affirmatively to Baker’s questions. In the end, Baker has failed to\n\ndemonstrate that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his motion for a\n\nchange of venue or continuance.\n\n                    VII. EXCESSIVE DAMAGES\n         PAIN AND SUFFERING IN THE UNDERLYING ACTION\n\n               Baker argues that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a\n\nnew trial based upon the excessiveness of the jury’s award of damages in the\n\nunderlying action. Baker maintains that the jury’s damage award of $250,000 for\n\npain and suffering was the result of passion and prejudice. In support thereof,\n\nBaker cites to “cumulative inflammatory testimony and innuendo [that] was\n\nrendered on the hot-button issue of police abuse of African-Americans.” Baker’s\n\nBrief at 40.\n\n\n                                           -39-\n\f             Under CR 59.01(d), a new trial may be granted upon the basis of\n\nexcessive damages that appear to be the result of passion or prejudice. As an\n\nappellate court, our review is deferential to the trial court:\n\n             The amount of damages is a dispute left to the sound\n             discretion of the jury, and its determination should not be\n             set aside merely because we would have reached a\n             different conclusion. If the verdict bears any reasonable\n             relationship to the evidence of loss suffered, it is the duty\n             of the trial court and this Court not to disturb the jury’s\n             assessment of damages.\n\nHazelwood v. Beauchamp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1495693\"><a href=\"/opinion/1495693/hazelwood-v-beauchamp/#440\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Hazelwood v. Beauchamp\">766 S.W.2d 439, 440</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Ky. App. 1989).\n\n             As we have reversed the jury’s award of $250,000 for Mulligan’s pain\n\nand suffering damages caused by Baker’s malpractice, there only remains the\n\njury’s award of $250,000 for Mulligan’s pain and suffering caused by Officer\n\nO’Daniel’s and Officer Kapanski’s conduct. Considering the evidence adduced at\n\ntrial, it is clear that the award of $250,000 in damages for pain and suffering in the\n\nunderlying action bears a reasonable relationship to the pain and suffering endured\n\nby Mulligan and was not the result of passion or prejudice. Mulligan testified\n\nextensively concerning the pain and suffering he endured as a result of Officer\n\nO’Daniel’s and Officer Kapanski’s use of excessive force and violation of\n\nMulligan’s civil rights on the night he was arrested and thereafter. The jury\n\ninstructions on this issue were sufficient. Consequently, we conclude that the trial\n\n\n\n\n                                          -40-\n\fcourt did not abuse its discretion by denying Baker’s motion for new trial for the\n\nexcessiveness of the jury’s award of damages in the underlying action.\n\n          VIII. DISQUALIFICATION OF MULLIGAN’S COUNSEL\n\n              Baker maintains that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to\n\ndisqualify Mulligan’s legal counsel. Baker argues that the trial court should have\n\ndisqualified both Hans Poppe and Kirk Laughlin as they might have been called as\n\na witness to testify at trial by Baker. Baker points out that the trial court ultimately\n\ndisqualified Laughlin but then permitted Laughlin to be seated near his colleagues\n\nduring trial. However, it is uncontroverted that Baker admittedly did not call either\n\nLaughlin or Poppe as a witness during trial. Given that Baker did not call either\n\nLaughlin or Poppe as witnesses at trial, any error is harmless.11\n\n                IX. DIRECTED VERDICT INDEMNIFICATION/\n                          THIRD PARTY CLAIM\n\n              Baker asserts that the trial court erred in granting a directed verdict\n\non his indemnification and third-party claims against Laughlin and the Poppe Law\n\nFirm. In his appellant’s brief, Baker’s entire argument consists of only five\n\nsentences, and he cites no legal authority therein. Baker’s Brief at 39. Baker’s\n\nargument plainly lacks supportive factual detail and sufficient legal analysis.\n\n\n11\n  When seeking review of a trial court’s ruling on a motion to disqualify legal counsel, the\nprimary method is to file a writ of prohibition/mandamus.

Mulligan argues that punitive damages are proper because Baker was\n\ngrossly negligent in his representation of Mulligan. When viewing the evidence\n\nmost favorable to him, Mulligan maintains that a reasonable juror could have\n\nfound that Baker was grossly negligent and that he was entitled to an award of\n\npunitive damages. Mulligan cites to evidence adduced at trial, which included that\n\nBaker withdrew from representing Mulligan in the underlying action; that Baker\n\nfailed to research the applicable statute of limitations which led to the dismissal of\n\n\n12\n   In the notice of appeal filed in this case, Kirk Laughlin and the Poppe Law Firm were named\nappellees, based on the directed verdict of Baker’s third-party claim. However, neither party\nfiled an appellee brief as required by the Kentucky Rules of Appellate Procedure (RAP) 30 and\n32. Notwithstanding, they improperly addressed this issue in Mulligan’s appellee brief at page\n45-47. Given Baker’s failure to articulate a valid argument on appeal, we have declined to\nimpose sanctions permitted under RAP 31(H)(3).\n\n                                             -42-\n\fall claims except one in federal court; that Baker failed to name Officer Kapanski\n\nin the complaint; that Baker failed to hire any expert witness; and that Baker failed\n\nto take any depositions in the underlying action.\n\n             The Kentucky Supreme Court has recognized that punitive damages\n\nmay be recovered in a legal malpractice action when the damages are based upon\n\nthe attorney’s conduct.

Moreover, there was evidence that Baker also may\n\nhave been negligent in other aspects of his representation of Mulligan in the\n\nunderlying civil action.

The Fund also requests that we direct the trial court to sign\nan order granting the motion for protective order.\n      Beard is the chair of the board of trustees that oversees the Fund. In each of\nits motions, the Fund argued that (1) the noticed deposition of Beard sought a so-\ncalled “apex” deposition and (2) CISD had not satisfied the necessary requirements\n\ffor proceeding with such a deposition. See, e.g., Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp. v.\nGarcia, 904 S.W.2d 125, 127 (Tex. 1995) (quoting Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Superior\nCt., 10 Cal. App. 4th 1282 (1992)).\n      After this mandamus action was filed, CISD withdrew its deposition notice\nand informed the Fund that it did not intend to depose Beard “at this time.” As a\nresult, the trial court signed an order that vacated its previous denials of the Fund’s\nmotions on the merits and instead denied the motions as moot. CISD now claims\nthat this mandamus action is likewise moot.\n      Because the Fund’s motion for protective order has not been granted and the\npossibility remains that the deposition of Beard will again be sought as the\nunderlying litigation progresses, this mandamus action is not moot. See In re\nContract Freighters, Inc., 646 S.W.3d 810, 813–14 (Tex. 2022) (The “[u]nilateral\nand unenforceable withdrawal of discovery, without any assurances that the\nwithdrawal is definite, and at the very hour ‘appellate courts are looking,’ does not\nmoot a discovery dispute.”); see also In re Allied Chem. Corp., 227 S.W.3d 652, 655\n(Tex. 2007). Further, mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that is “not issued\nsolely as a matter of right,” but at the discretion of the reviewing court. In re Walker,\n683 S.W.3d 400, 402 (Tex. 2024); see also Rivercenter Associates v. Rivera, 858\nS.W.2d 366, 367 (Tex. 1993).\n      In exercising our discretion, we must determine, among other things, whether\nthere is an adequate remedy by appeal. In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., 148 S.W.3d\n124, 135–36 (Tex. 2004). In assessing this question, the word “adequate” is “simply\na proxy for the careful balance of jurisprudential considerations that determine when\nappellate courts will use original mandamus proceedings to review the actions of\nlower courts.” Id. at 136. “An appellate remedy is ‘adequate’ when any benefits to\nmandamus review are outweighed by the determinants.” Id.\n\n                                           2\n\f        Because of CISD’s withdrawal of its deposition notice and the trial court’s\nsubsequent action in vacating its order, and for those reasons only, we conclude that\ndenying mandamus relief is proper in this instance. In so doing, we presume that,\nby its actions and representations, CISD is acting in good faith, and that it does not\nintend to re-notice and attempt to proceed with deposing Beard in the future, barring\nsome unforeseen development.\n        We also emphasize that we have not addressed the question of whether CISD\nis even entitled to depose Beard. We have merely concluded that the delay and the\nexpenses to be incurred in proceeding with mandamus relief at this time outweighs\nthe potential benefits. See Wagner v. Apache Corp., 627 S.W.3d 277, 288 n.4 (Tex.\n2021) (“[T]he writ of mandamus is a discretionary writ, and we decline\nto exercise our discretion to issue it in this case.”). The Fund is free to seek\nmandamus relief in the future should CISD again seek to depose Beard. See TEX. R.\nAPP. P. 52.8(a).\n        For the reasons we have stated, the petition for writ of mandamus is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           W.

See TEX.\nPENAL CODE ANN. § 22.01(b)(2)(A) (West Supp. 2024). Pursuant to the terms of a\n\fnegotiated plea agreement between Appellant and the State, the trial court found\nAppellant guilty of the charged offense and assessed his punishment at\nimprisonment for five years in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of\nCriminal Justice; however, the trial court suspended the imposition of Appellant’s\nsentence and placed him on community supervision for five years. The State\nsubsequently filed a motion to revoke Appellant’s community supervision, then\namended it and alleged that Appellant failed to report as required, traveled outside\nthe counties of supervision without permission, failed to notify his supervision\nofficer of changes in his contact information within 48 hours, and failed to pay\nvarious fees and costs.\n      The trial court held a hearing on the State’s amended motion to revoke on\nMarch 21, 2024, during which Appellant pled “true” to the allegations in the\namended motion. The trial court accepted Appellant’s pleas of “true” and adjourned\nto allow the parties to present punishment evidence at a subsequent sentencing\nhearing. At the sentencing hearing, the State presented the testimony of three\nwitnesses, including the victim of the underlying assaultive offense; Appellant\npresented one witness. Upon the conclusion of this hearing, the trial court found the\nallegations in the amended motion to be “true,” revoked Appellant’s community\nsupervision, and imposed the originally assessed five-year sentence.\n      Appellant’s court-appointed counsel has filed a motion to withdraw in this\ncourt. The motion is supported by a brief in which counsel professionally and\nconscientiously examines the record and applicable law and concludes that there are\nno arguable issues to present on appeal. See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738\n(1967); In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d 403, 406–09 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). Counsel\nhas provided Appellant with a copy of the brief, a copy of the motion to withdraw,\n\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fan explanatory letter, and a copy of the clerk’s record and reporter’s record. Counsel\nalso advised Appellant of his right to review the record and file a response to\ncounsel’s brief, and of his right to file a petition for discretionary review.\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 68. As such, court-appointed counsel has complied with the\nrequirements of Anders, 386 U.S. at 742–44, Kelly v. State, 436 S.W.3d 313 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2014), Schulman, 252 S.W.3d at 409–12, and Stafford v. State, 813\nS.W.2d 503 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\n        Appellant has not filed a pro se response to counsel’s Anders brief. Following\nthe procedures outlined in Anders and Schulman, we have independently reviewed\nthe record, and likewise conclude that the appeal is without merit. See Anders, 386\nU.S. at 744; Bledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824, 826–27 & n.6 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2005). Here, Appellant pled “true” to the violations alleged in the State’s amended\nmotion to revoke, which the trial court accepted and found to be “true.” We note\nthat proof of one violation of the terms and conditions of a probationer’s community\nsupervision, without more, is sufficient to support the trial court’s revocation order.\nSmith v. State, 286 S.W.3d 333, 342 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009); Sanchez v. State, 603\nS.W.2d 869, 871 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1980); Jones v. State, 472 S.W.3d\n322, 324 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2015, pet. ref’d). In this regard, Appellant’s pleas\nof “true,” standing alone, are sufficient to support the trial court’s decision to revoke\nAppellant’s community supervision and its revocation order. See Garcia v. State,\n387 S.W.3d 20, 26 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012); Moses v. State, 590 S.W.2d 469, 470\n(Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.] 1979). Therefore, based on our independent review\nof the record, we agree with counsel that no arguable grounds for appeal exist.1\n\n\n\n        We note that Appellant has the right to file a petition for discretionary review with the Court of\n        1\n\nCriminal Appeals. See TEX. R. APP. P. 68.\n\n\n\n                                                    3\n\f      Accordingly, we grant counsel’s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the\njudgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                               W.

See TEX. PENAL CODE ANN. § 37.10(c)(1)\n\n       1\n         This appeal was transferred to this court from the Second Court of Appeals pursuant to a docket\nequalization order issued by the Texas Supreme Court. See TEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 73.001 (West Supp.\n2024). We decide this case in accordance with the precedent of the Second Court of Appeals under the\nprinciple of stare decisis. TEX. R. APP. P. 41.3.\n\f(West Supp. 2024). On September 16, 2021, pursuant to the terms of a negotiated\nplea agreement between Appellant and the State, the trial court found Appellant\nguilty, assessed his punishment at confinement for two years in the State Jail\nDivision of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, suspended his sentence, and\nplaced him on community supervision for a period of five years. As conditions of\nhis community supervision, Appellant was required to, inter alia, follow all state and\nfederal laws, abstain from using or possessing illegal substances, submit to urinalysis\ndrug screens, complete a drug offender education program (DOEP), and complete\n180 hours of community service. Following Appellant’s arrest on March 17, 2023\nfor possession with intent to use a device designed to falsify drug test results, the\ntrial court ordered Appellant to surrender to the Cooke County Jail on May 26, 2023\nto serve a fifteen-day jail sanction. See TEX. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE ANN.\n§ 481.133(a) (West 2017).      Appellant did not turn himself in, and the State\nsubsequently moved to revoke his community supervision based on five alleged\nviolations.\n      The trial court held a hearing on March 26, 2024, during which the State orally\namended its motion to revoke; Appellant’s counsel had no objection to the\namendment and announced that he was ready to proceed. Appellant pleaded “true”\nto the allegation that he used marihuana, and “not true” to the remaining allegations.\nThe State called two witnesses, then Appellant testified. Appellant admitted to the\ntrial court that he did not complete his community service hours, did not participate\nin DOEP, failed to report for his jail sanction, and attempted to falsify his drug test\nresults because he “was dirty.” Upon the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court\nfound all six violations alleged to be “true,” revoked Appellant’s community\nsupervision, and imposed the original sentence of confinement for two years in the\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fState Jail Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. The trial court\nfurther ordered Appellant to pay the balance of the originally assessed $1,500 fine.\n      Appellant’s court-appointed counsel has filed a motion to withdraw in this\ncourt. The motion is supported by a brief in which counsel professionally and\nconscientiously examines the record and applicable law, and concludes that there are\nno arguable issues to present on appeal. See Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738\n(1967); In re Schulman, 252 S.W.3d 403, 406–09 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008). Counsel\nhas provided Appellant with a copy of the brief, a copy of the motion to withdraw,\nan explanatory letter, and a copy of the clerk’s record and the reporter’s record.\nCounsel also advised Appellant of his right to review the record and file a response\nto counsel’s brief, and of his right to file a petition for discretionary review.\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 68. As such, court-appointed counsel has complied with the\nrequirements of Anders, 386 U.S. at 742–44, Kelly v. State, 436 S.W.3d 313 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2014), Schulman, 252 S.W.3d at 409–12, and Stafford v. State, 813\nS.W.2d 503 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\n      Appellant has not filed a pro se response to counsel’s Anders brief. Following\nthe procedures outlined in Anders and Schulman, we have independently reviewed\nthe record, and likewise conclude that the appeal is without merit. See Anders, 386\nU.S. at 744; Bledsoe v. State, 178 S.W.3d 824, 826–27 & n.6 (Tex. Crim. App.\n2005). Here, although Appellant pleaded “not true” to all but one allegation in the\nState’s motion, he testified that he violated several conditions of his community\nsupervision, which the trial court found to be “true.” Proof of one violation of the\nterms and conditions of a probationer’s community supervision is sufficient to\nsupport the trial court’s revocation order. Smith v. State, 286 S.W.3d 333, 342 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2009); Sanchez v. State, 603 S.W.2d 869, 871 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel\nOp.] 1980); Jones v. State, 472 S.W.3d 322, 324 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2015, pet.\n\n\n                                         3\n\fref’d). In this regard, Appellant’s plea of “true” to a single violation, standing alone,\nwas sufficient to support the trial court’s revocation order. See Garcia v. State, 387\nS.W.3d 20, 26 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012); Moses v. State, 590 S.W.2d 469, 470 (Tex.\nCrim. App. [Panel Op.] 1979). Therefore, based on our independent review of the\nrecord, we agree with counsel that no arguable grounds for appeal exist.2\n        Accordingly, we grant counsel’s motion to withdraw, and affirm the judgment\nof the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                         JOHN M.

See TEX. TAX CODE ANN. §§ 313.001–.171 (West 2015).              Per the\nrequirements of the TEDA at that time, the school district sent a copy of the\n\fapplication to the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts (the Comptroller). See Act\nof May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 6, sec. 313.025(b), 2013 Tex. Gen.\nLaws 3317, 3321 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). The Comptroller then performed an\neconomic impact evaluation and issued a certificate of limitation on appraised value.\nAfter it received the certificate, the school district approved the application.\nThereafter, Appellant, Suzonne Franks, brought suit against the Comptroller’s\noffice, as well as Glenn Hegar, in his official capacity as the Texas Comptroller,\nseeking among other things a declaratory judgment that the certificate was void. The\nComptroller then filed a plea to the jurisdiction. The trial court granted the plea to\nthe jurisdiction, and this appeal followed. We affirm.\n                       The Texas Economic Development Act\n      The TEDA was created to attract manufacturing and other capital-intensive\nprojects to Texas by temporarily limiting taxes that are imposed on new capital\ninvestments. TAX § 313.002. The majority of the Act expired in 2022. TAX\n§ 313.007. However, prior to 2023, the statute provided a means by which property\nowners could apply for limitations on the appraised value of their property. See Act\nof May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304 § 6, sec. 313.025(b-1), 2013 Tex. Gen.\nLaws 3317, 3321–22 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Specifically, the TEDA provided that\n“[t]he owner or lessee of, or the holder of another possessory interest in, any\nqualified property . . . may apply to the governing body of the school district in which\nthe property is located for a limitation on the appraised value.” Act of May 26, 2013,\n83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 6, sec. 313.025(a), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317, 3321\n(expired Dec. 31, 2022) (emphasis added).\n      The TEDA did not require an applicant to be the owner of the land itself.\nInstead, the TEDA explicitly contemplated that “[q]ualified property” included\n(a) land “on which a person proposes to construct a new building or erect or affix a\n\n                                           2\n\fnew improvement” that did not exist before the application was submitted, (b) the\nnew building or improvement itself, and (c) any tangible personal property that\nwould be “first placed in service” in a new or expanded facility. Act of May 26,\n2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 3, sec. 313.021(2)(A)(ii), (2)(B), (2)(C)(ii), 2013\nTex. Gen. Laws 3317, 3319 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Thus, persons and entities with\npossessory interests in the improvements or tangible personal property that would\nfirst be put into service in a new or expanded facility could likewise apply for a\nlimitation.\n      Additionally, “[q]ualified property” included, among other things, property\nthat was “located in an area designated as a reinvestment zone.” Act of May 26,\n2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 3, sec. 313.021(2)(A)(i), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws\n3317, 3319 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Likewise, the proposed improvement to the\nproperty was required to create at least twenty-five new jobs. Act of May 26, 2013,\n83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 3, sec. 313.021(2)(A)(iv)(b), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317,\n3319 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). However, the school district was authorized to waive\nthis requirement upon a finding that “the jobs creation requirement exceeds the\nindustry standard for the number of employees reasonably necessary for the\noperation of the facility.” Act of May 22, 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., ch. 864, § 3,\nsec. 313.025(f-1), 2007 Tex. Gen. Laws 1830, 1831 (expired Dec. 31, 2022).\n      The school district was not required to consider an application for a limitation\non appraised value.     Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 6,\nsec. 313.025(b), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317, 3321 (expired Dec. 31, 2022).\nHowever, if the school district elected to consider an application, the school district\nwas required to request that the Comptroller undertake an economic impact\nevaluation of the proposal contained within the application. Id.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      The Comptroller was then tasked with two requirements.              First, the\nComptroller was required to consider whether the project was “reasonably likely to\ngenerate . . . tax revenue” in accordance with certain standards that were set out in\nthe TEDA. Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 7, sec. 313.026(c),\n2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317, 3324 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Second, the Comptroller\nwas required to consider whether “the limitation on appraised value [was] a\ndetermining factor in the applicant’s decision to invest capital and construct the\nproject.” Id. If those two criteria were met, the Comptroller was required to issue a\ncertificate. Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 6, sec. 313.025(d),\n2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317, 3322 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). If the criteria were not\nmet, the Comptroller was required to provide a “written explanation of the\ncomptroller’s decision not to issue a certificate.” Id. However, even if the criteria\nwere not met, the Comptroller was still authorized to issue a certificate “if the\ncomptroller [made] a qualitative determination that other considerations associated\nwith the project result in a net positive benefit to the state.” Act of May 26, 2013,\n83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 7, sec. 313.026(f), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317, 3324\n(expired Dec. 31, 2022).\n      If a certificate was issued by the Comptroller, the school district was charged\nwith either approving or disapproving the application. Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd\nLeg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 6, sec. 313.025(b), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317, 3321 (expired\nDec. 31, 2022). The school district was further authorized to designate an area\nwithin the school district as a reinvestment zone at the same time it granted the\nlimitation on appraised value. TAX § 312.0025(a).\n                                 Background Facts\n      The RWP is a wind energy facility that is located in the easternmost portion\nof Callahan County. Franks filed suit as a resident and landowner in Eastland\n\n                                          4\n\fCounty. She filed the underlying suit in Eastland County alleging that venue was\nproper because the RWP affected her property in Eastland County.\n      On August 24, 2020, the RWP submitted an Application for Appraised Value\nLimitation on Qualified Property to BISD. Thereafter, the school district forwarded\nthe application to the Comptroller.       The application described the “qualified\nproperty” at issue as turbines, a substation, transmission line, and other proposed\nimprovements to the land on which the facility would be located. Likewise, it\nexplicitly indicated that the proposed qualified property would not consist of land.\nThe application also included a letter requesting a partial waiver of the TEDA jobs\nrequirement, indicating that the facility would “create 3 full time permanent\npositions” and that the number of jobs was “congruent with industry standards for\nrenewable energy facilities.”\n      The Comptroller’s analysis showed that the proposed project would likely\ngenerate sufficient tax revenue to offset the losses resulting from the agreement, and\nthat the limitation on appraised value was a “determining factor in the applicant’s\ndecision to invest capital and construct the project.” As such, the Comptroller issued\na certificate for a limitation on the appraised value of the property. Thereafter, on\nFebruary 22, 2021, the school district and the RWP entered into an agreement\nlimiting the appraised value of the property.\n      Franks filed suit against the Comptroller on August 30, 2022, asserting a claim\nunder the Private Real Property Rights Preservation Act (the Property Act). See\nTEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 2007.001–.045 (West 2016). In her petition, she\ncomplained that the RWP’s application did not meet the statutory requirements to\nbe approved for a tax limitation, and requested a declaratory judgment that the\ncertificate issued for the RWP is void.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f      Franks further alleged that the Comptroller’s action in issuing the certificate\nwas an ultra vires act that was attributable to Hegar in his official capacity. See Tex.\nDep’t of Transp. v. Sefzik, 355 S.W.3d 618, 621 (Tex. 2011) (Ultra vires is an\nexception to sovereign immunity “under which claims may be brought against a state\nofficial for nondiscretionary acts unauthorized by law.”).\n      Notably, Franks did not bring suit against the school district, challenge the\nschool district’s findings in support of the agreement, or request any relief restricting\nthe manner in which ongoing taxes are collected from the RWP.\n      After Franks brought suit, the Comptroller filed a plea to the jurisdiction,\nwhich was granted by the district court. This appeal followed.\n                                Statutory Construction\n      “We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo, as they are\nquestions of law.” Butler v. City of Big Spring, 652 S.W.3d 149, 152 (Tex. App.—\nEastland 2022, pet. denied). When interpreting a statute, we must “ascertain and\ngive effect to the Legislature’s intent.” Bexar Appraisal Dist. v. Johnson, 691\nS.W.3d 844, 847 (Tex. 2024) (quoting Odyssey 2020 Acad., Inc. v. Galveston Cent.\nAppraisal Dist., 624 S.W.3d 535, 540 (Tex. 2021)); Butler, 652 S.W.3d at 152. “We\nlook for that intent first and foremost in the plain language of the constitutional or\nstatutory provision.” Odyssey, 624 S.W.3d at 540; see also Butler, 652 S.W.3d at\n152. “If the statute’s plain language is unambiguous, we interpret its plain meaning,\npresuming that the Legislature intended for each of the statute’s words to have a\npurpose.” Johnson, 691 S.W.3d at 847 (quoting Silguero v. CSL Plasma, Inc., 579\nS.W.3d 53, 59 (Tex. 2019)); see also Butler, 652 S.W.3d at 152 (“[O]ur objective is\nto ‘ascertain[] and giv[e] effect to the legislature’s intent as expressed by the plain\nand common meaning of the statute’s words.’” (quoting Wichita Cnty. v. Bonnin,\n268 S.W.3d 811, 817 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2008, pet. denied))). Statutory terms\n\n                                           6\n\fthat are not defined by the legislature “usually bear their common, ordinary\nmeaning.” Johnson, 691 S.W.3d at 847. Furthermore, when interpreting a statute\nthat an agency is charged with enforcing, the agency’s interpretation is entitled to\n“‘serious consideration,’ so long as the construction is reasonable and does not\nconflict with the statute’s language.” R.R. Comm’n of Tex. v. Tex. Citizens for a Safe\nFuture & Clean Water, 336 S.W.3d 619, 624 (Tex. 2011) (quoting First Am. Title\nIns. Co. v. Combs, 258 S.W.3d 627, 632 (Tex. 2008)).1\n                                       The Issue in Dispute\n       In her sole issue on appeal, Franks complains that the trial court erred when it\ngranted the Comptroller’s plea to the jurisdiction.\n            In its plea to the jurisdiction, the Comptroller argued that Franks did not have\nstanding to assert claims against the Comptroller and that Franks’s claims were\nbarred by sovereign immunity. Franks argues that the trial court erred in granting\nthe judgment because (1) sovereign immunity does not apply to her ultra vires claim,\n(2) sovereign immunity has been waived by the State under the circumstances of this\ncase, and (3) she has pleaded the facts necessary to establish standing.\n                                            Ultra Vires\n        “Sovereign immunity and its counterpart, governmental immunity, exist to\nprotect the State and its political subdivisions from lawsuits and liability for money\ndamages.” Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 253 S.W.3d 653, 655 (Tex.\n2008); AIM Media Tex., LLC v. City of Odessa, 663 S.W.3d 324, 333 (Tex. App.—\nEastland 2023, pet. denied). However, “an action to determine or protect a private\nparty’s rights against a state official who has acted ultra vires–that is, without legal\nor statutory authority—is not a suit against the State that sovereign immunity bars.”\n\n        1\n         In this instance, the TEDA required the Comptroller to “adopt rules and forms necessary for the\nimplementation and administration” of the Act.

Co. v. City of\nHouston, 487 S.W.3d 154, 163 (Tex. 2016) (emphasis omitted).                                 However,\ngovernment officers that are given limited discretion to interpret and apply the law\nact “without legal authority” when they exceed the bounds of their granted authority\nor act in conflict with the law itself. Id. at 158.\n        “[A]s a technical matter, the governmental entities themselves—as opposed\nto their officers in their official capacity—remain immune from suit.” Heinrich, 284\nS.W.3d at 372–73. As such, lawsuits alleging that public officials have acted ultra\nvires must be brought against the public officials themselves, rather than the entities\nwith which the officials are associated. Id. at 373.\n        Franks maintains that sovereign immunity does not apply because Hegar was\nacting ultra vires2 when the certificate was issued. Specifically, Franks argues that,\nbecause the properties that were the subject of the application did not satisfy the\nTEDA’s definition of “qualified properties” at the time the application was\nsubmitted, Hegar was acting without legal authority.\n        The tax limitations that were available under the TEDA were available only\nfor “qualified properties.” See Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 6,\nsec. 313.025, 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317, 3321 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). A\n“qualified property” was in turn defined as a property “that is located in an area\ndesignated as a reinvestment zone under Chapter 311 or 312 [of the Tax Code] or\n\n        2\n          The Latin phrase “ultra vires” means “beyond the powers (of),” and as a legal term, refers to an\nact that is “[u]nauthorized” or “beyond the scope of power allowed or granted . . . by law.” Ultra vires,\nBLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (12th ed. 2024).\n                                                    8\n\fas an enterprise zone under Chapter 2303” of the Texas Government Code. Act of\nMay 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 3, sec. 313.021(2), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws\n3317, 3319 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Likewise, the TEDA indicated that a “qualified\nproperty” must be the subject of a proposal to “make a qualified investment” of a\nspecified minimum amount, which also creates twenty-five new qualifying jobs. Id.\n      Franks argues that that Hegar acted without legal authority when he issued the\ncertificate because the application did not describe a “qualified property” as required\nby the statute. Specifically, Franks asserts that the application did not describe a\n“qualified property” because: (1) it was not located in a reinvestment or enterprise\nzone at the time the certificate was issued, (2) the RWP was not an owner, lessee, or\nholder of any other possessory interest in the property at the time of the application,\nand (3) it did not propose to create at least twenty-five new qualifying jobs.\n      Franks misapprehends the Comptroller’s purpose and role in the approval\nprocess. In issuing the certificate, the Comptroller’s role was limited to undertaking\nthe economic impact analysis, determining whether the project would generate\nsufficient revenue, and ascertaining whether the approval of the exemption would\nbe a determining factor for the RWP. See Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S.,\nch. 1304, § 7, sec. 313.026(c), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317, 3324 (expired Dec. 31,\n2022). By contrast, the Comptroller was not required to consider any of the factors\nthat are enumerated by Franks.\n      The limited role that was played by the Comptroller in issuing the certificate\nis further underscored by our reading of the statute, which contemplates that\nrealization of the statutory requirements described by Franks may not occur until\nafter the parties have entered into an agreement for limitation of value.\n      First, while the TEDA required a property with a limitation on value to be in\na reinvestment or enterprise zone, it did not require that the reinvestment or\n\n                                          9\n\fenterprise zone exist at the time the application was submitted. See Act of May 26,\n2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 3, sec. 313.021(2)(A)(i), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws\n3317, 3319 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Likewise, it did not require that the zone exist\nat the time a certificate was considered or issued by the Comptroller. See id. Instead,\nthe language of the Tax Code indicated that the school district could have first\nrecognized an investment zone at the time the application was granted. Under\nSection 312.0025(a) of the Tax Code, a school district “may designate an area . . . as\na reinvestment zone if the governing body finds that, as a result of the designation\nand the granting of a limitation on appraised value . . . the designation is reasonably\nlikely to . . . contribute to the expansion of primary employment . . . or . . . attract\nmajor investment.”      TAX § 312.0025(a) (emphasis added).             This language\ncontemplated that the “designation and the granting of a limitation” may occur\nsimultaneously. Id. As such, Hegar was not acting ultra vires when he issued a\ncertificate in connection with property that was not yet located in an investment or\nenterprise zone.\n      Franks argues that, because Section 312.0025(a) anticipates future\nemployment and investment, the statute is “forward looking” and that it must\ntherefore, be contemplating that the reinvestment or enterprise zone would exist\nbefore the certificate is issued. This argument is unpersuasive. The realization of\nemployment opportunities and major investment, as described in the statute, need\nnot (and often will not) occur until after the school board gives final approval to the\nproject. As such, the designation of a reinvestment or enterprise zone will almost\nalways be “forward looking,” regardless of whether it occurs before the application\nprocess or at any point during the application process.\n      Second, with respect to Franks’s argument that the RWP was not an owner,\nlessee, or holder of a possessory interest in the property at issue, we note that the\n\n                                          10\n\fTEDA contemplated that the property that was the subject of the application might\nnot exist at the time the application and/or certificate was issued. Specifically, the\nstatute recognized that new improvements and buildings that are “propose[d]” at the\ntime of application constituted qualified property. See Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd\nLeg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 3, sec. 313.021(2)(A)(ii), (B), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317,\n3319 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Furthermore, since buildings and improvements, as\nwell as tangible personal property could meet the definition of “qualified property,”\nthe applicant was not required to hold a possessory interest in the land itself at any\ntime, much less at the time the certificate is issued by the Comptroller. See Act of\nMay 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 3, sec. 313.021(2), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws\n3317, 3319 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Accordingly, we likewise conclude that Hegar\nwas not acting ultra vires when he issued a certificate in connection with proposed\nownership of improvements.\n      Finally, we note that, because the school district ultimately had the authority\nto waive or alter the statutory jobs requirements, and because the application itself\nindicated that a waiver was requested, Hegar was not acting ultra vires based on the\napplication’s failure to signal that the project would not create twenty-five jobs. See\nAct of May 22, 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., ch. 864, § 3, sec. 313.025(f-1), 2007 Tex.\nGen. Laws 1830, 1831 (expired Dec. 31, 2022).\n      The Comptroller maintains that “the TEDA’s requirements may be satisfied\nafter the certificate issues.” The Comptroller’s reading of the TEDA is consistent\nwith our own, and we conclude it to be reasonable and free of conflict with the\nlanguage of the TEDA. See Tex. Citizens, 336 S.W.3d at 624. As such, we hold that\nHegar was not acting ultra vires when he issued the certificate.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f                           Waiver of Sovereign Immunity\n      Franks also argues that sovereign immunity is not applicable to her cause of\naction under the Property Act because sovereign immunity is expressly waived\ntherein.\n      The State retains sovereign immunity from suit to the extent that immunity\nhas not been abrogated by the legislature.       See Tex. Nat. Res. Conservation\nComm’n v. IT–Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 853 (Tex. 2002); AIM Media, 663 S.W.3d at\n333. It is within the sole province of the Texas Legislature to waive or abrogate\nsovereign immunity. Fed. Sign, 951 S.W.2d at 409; AIM Media, 663 S.W.3d at 334.\n      The Property Act requires governmental entities, including state agencies, to\nconduct a “written takings impact” in connection with certain “proposed\ngovernmental action[s].” GOV’T § 2007.043(a). The “governmental actions” that\nare subject to the Property Act are subdivided into the following four categories:\n            (1) the adoption or issuance of an ordinance, rule, regulatory\n      requirement, resolution, policy, guideline, or similar measure;\n\n            (2) an action that imposes a physical invasion or requires a\n      dedication or exaction of private real property;\n\n             (3) an action by a municipality that has effect in the\n      extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality, excluding annexation,\n      and that enacts or enforces an ordinance, rule, regulation, or plan that\n      does not impose identical requirements or restrictions in the entire\n      extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality; and\n             (4) enforcement of a governmental action listed in Subdivisions\n      (1) through (3), whether the enforcement of the governmental action is\n      accomplished through the use of permitting, citations, orders, judicial\n      or quasi-judicial proceedings, or other similar means.\nGOV’T § 2007.003(a).      A takings impact analysis is required for categories\n(1) through (3), but not for category (4). GOV’T § 2007.043(a). If a governmental\nentity fails to conduct the takings impact, an affected private real property owner\n                                         12\n\f“may bring suit for a declaration of the invalidity of the governmental action.”\nGOV’T § 2007.044(a).\n      The Comptroller asserts that, when it issued the certificate, it was not engaged\nin a “governmental action” that falls within one of the first three categories\nin Section 2007.003(a).    Franks disagrees, arguing that the issuance of the\ncertificate was a “regulatory requirement, resolution, . . . or similar measure” under\nSection 2007.003(a)(1).\n      We conclude that the Comptroller’s action in issuing a certificate was\nnot a “regulatory requirement, resolution, . . . or similar measure” under\nSection 2007.003(a)(1).    In order to maintain a clear separation of powers in\naccordance with the requirements of our constitution, Texas courts have traditionally\ndivided the functions of administrative agencies into two categories: quasi-\nlegislative and quasi-judicial. TEX. CONST. art. II, § 1 (establishing three branches\nof government and stating that “no person, or collection of persons, being of one of\nthese departments, shall exercise any power properly attached to either of the\nothers”); Key W. Life Ins. Co. v. State Bd. of Ins., 350 S.W.2d 839, 848 (1961)\n(recognizing the importance of a separation of powers and holding that the State\nBoard of Insurance was acting in a judicial capacity when it acted to approve a\nparticular policy form); Macias v. Rylander, 995 S.W.2d 829, 832 (Tex. App.—\nAustin 1999, no pet.). “Generally, an administrative agency acts in a legislative\ncapacity when it addresses broad questions of public policy and promulgates rules\nfor future application ‘to all or some part of those subject to its power.’” Macias,\n995 S.W.2d at 833 (quoting Key W. Life, 350 S.W.2d at 847). “A judicial inquiry,\non the other hand, typically involves an investigation of present or past facts and a\ndetermination of liability based on laws already in existence.” Id.\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f      The legislature appears to have had this distinction in mind when it enacted\nSection 2007.003(a). Subsection (a)(1), which concerns the adoption of rules and\nguidelines, including regulatory requirements, attempts to describe governmental\nactions that address broader questions of public policy that apply to a large number\nof people. GOV’T § 2007.003(a)(1). On the other hand, subsection (a)(4) concerns\nthe investigation and application of facts based on laws already in existence,\nincluding “quasi-judicial proceedings.” Id. § 2007.003(a)(4).\n      “Texas courts have developed a six-factor test to determine whether an entity\n‘was acting in a quasi-judicial, or merely an administrative, capacity’ at the relevant\ntime.” Doe v. Cruz, 683 S.W.3d 475, 496 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2023, no pet.)\n(quoting Vill. of Bayou Vista v. Glaskox, 899 S.W.2d 826, 829 (Tex. App.—Houston\n[14th Dist.] 1995, no pet.)). The factors include:\n       1) the power to exercise judgment and discretion; 2) the power to hear\n      and determine or to ascertain facts and decide; 3) the power to make\n      binding orders and judgments; 4) the power to affect the personal or\n      property rights of private persons; 5) the power to examine witnesses,\n      to compel the attendance of witnesses, and to hear the litigation of\n      issues on a hearing; and 6) the power to enforce decisions or impose\n      penalties.\nCruz, 683 S.W.3d at 496 (quoting Glaskox, 899 S.W.2d at 829).\n      In this instance, the RWP applied for a tax limitation, and—as a part of the\napplication process—the Comptroller was responsible for determining whether to\nissue a certificate for limitation on appraised value. See Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd\nLeg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 7, sec. 313.026(c), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317, 3324 (expired\nDec. 31, 2022). The “governmental actions” that are involved in this process include\nthe exercise of judgment and discretion (factor 1), the power to hear and determine\nfacts and make decisions (factor 2), the power to make binding decisions (factor 3),\nand the power to affect the property rights of private persons (factor 4). The actions\n\n                                          14\n\fof the Comptroller in this case do not satisfy all of the factors that are considered by\nTexas courts when assessing the nature of a governmental action. However, “[a]n\nadministrative agency need not have all [such] powers to be considered quasi-\njudicial.” Parker v. Holbrook, 647 S.W.2d 692, 695 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\nDist.] 1982, writ ref’d n.r.e.). Rather, “the more of these powers it has, the more\nclearly is it quasi-judicial in the exercise of its powers.” Id.\n      Based on the factors described above, we conclude that the Comptroller was\nserving a quasi-judicial function when it issued the certificate.3 As such, a takings\nimpact assessment was not required. See GOV’T § 2007.043(a).\n      Furthermore, the Property Act indicates that no takings impact assessment is\nrequired where “the enforcement of the governmental action is accomplished\nthrough the use of permitting . . . or other similar means.” GOV’T §§ 2007.003(a),\n2007.043(a). We conclude that the process of applying for a tax accommodation,\ntogether with the process of securing a certificate for limitation on appraised value\nis similar to the process for securing a permit, which likewise involves the\nconsideration of whether a particular party should be permitted to undertake an\nactivity or be exempted from a requirement. See Tex. Gen. Land Office v. La Concha\nCondo. Ass’n, No. 13-19-00357-CV, 2020 WL 2610934, at *8 (Tex. App.—Corpus\nChristi–Edinburg May 21, 2020, no pet.) (“[W]hen a government defendant merely\n‘enforce[s]’ another governmental action via ‘permitting, citations, orders, judicial\nor quasi-judicial proceedings, or other similar means,’ the [takings impact\nassessment] requirement does not apply.” (quoting GOV’T § 2007.043(a))); see also\nTEX. LOC. GOV’T CODE ANN. § 245.001 (West 2016) (defining a permit, in part, as\nan “authorization required by law, rule, regulation, order, or ordinance that a person\n\n\n      3\n       The school board was likewise serving the same function when it approved the application.\n\n                                                15\n\fmust obtain to perform an action or initiate, continue, or complete a project for which\nthe permit is sought”). As such, even if the issuance of a certificate under the TEDA\nwere not a quasi-judicial function, we would still conclude that a takings analysis is\nnot required because the issuance of a certificate is “similar” to the issuance of a\npermit.\n      We conclude that sovereign immunity has not been waived for purposes of\nFranks’s claims, since a takings analysis was not required in connection with the\nissuance of the certificate and/or the approval of the application.\n                                      Standing\n      In its plea to the jurisdiction, the Comptroller also argued that Franks lacked\nstanding to bring suit. We note that the El Paso Court of Appeals recently addressed\na similar claim with respect to standing in Green v. Tex. Comptroller of Pub. Accts.,\n697 S.W.3d 305 (Tex. App.—El Paso 2023, pet. filed). Green also involved a claim\nagainst the Comptroller for the issuance of a certificate of limitation on appraised\nvalue under Chapter 313 of the Tax Code. Id. at 307. The project at issue in Green\nwas another wind project involving the Baird Independent School District. Id. at\n309. The suit in Green was filed in Callahan County, appealed to this court, and\nthen transferred to the El Paso Court of Appeals by order of the Texas Supreme\nCourt. Id. at 308 n.1. The El Paso Court of Appeals determined that the taxpayers\nin Green lacked standing because they were unable to show that their claimed injury\nwas fairly traceable to the Comptroller’s actions. Id. at 313.\n      “Standing is a constitutional prerequisite to maintaining suit in either federal\nor state court.” Sneed v. Webre, 465 S.W.3d 169, 179–80 (Tex. 2015) (quoting\nWilliams v. Lara, 52 S.W.3d 171, 178 (Tex. 2001)). Thus, “[a] challenge to a party’s\nstanding is an attack on the party’s ability under the United States and Texas\nConstitutions to assert a claim.” Green, 697 S.W.3d at 311 (quoting Tex. Med. Res.,\n\n                                          16\n\fLLP v. Molina Healthcare of Tex., Inc., 659 S.W.3d 424, 440 (Tex. 2023)). In\nassessing standing, Texas courts have adopted the federal standing requirements that\nare set out in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992). Data Foundry,\nInc. v. City of Austin, 620 S.W.3d 692, 696 (Tex. 2021).\n      “To maintain standing, a plaintiff must show: (1) an injury in fact that is both\nconcrete and particularized and actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical;\n(2) that the injury is fairly traceable to the defendant’s challenged action; and (3) that\nit is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a\nfavorable decision.” Data Foundry, 620 S.W.3d at 696.\n      Under the first element of the standing test, a plaintiff must normally\n“demonstrate that he or she possesses an interest in a conflict distinct from that of\nthe general public, such that the defendant’s actions have caused the plaintiff some\nparticular injury.”   Williams, 52 S.W.3d at 178–79.          However, a taxpayer is\nconsidered to have sufficient interest in the subject-matter of a lawsuit when bringing\n“an action to restrain the illegal expenditure . . . of tax money.” Bland Indep. Sch.\nDist. v. Blue, 34 S.W.3d 547, 556 (Tex. 2000) (quoting Hoffman v. Davis,\n100 S.W.2d 94, 96 (Tex. 1937)). Likewise, the legislature may choose to create\nstatutory terms that confer standing on a particular class of litigants. See, e.g.,\nHunt v. Bass, 664 S.W.2d 323, 324 (Tex. 1984) (The “general rule of standing is\napplied in all cases absent a statutory exception to the contrary.”).\n      Franks maintains that she has established standing under three separate\nprinciples. First, Franks argues that she has established generalized standing under\nthe standards enunciated in Lujan and Data Foundry. Second, she argues that she\nhas standing to bring suit as a taxpayer under the standards set out in Bland. Finally,\nshe argues that she has established “statutory standing” under the terms of the\nProperty Act. See GOV’T § 2007.044(a).\n\n                                           17\n\f      A. Generalized Standing\n      In support of her argument that she has satisfied the first element of Lujan and\nData Foundry, Franks argues that she has suffered a “concrete and particularized”\ninjury because (1) “her tax money is being used to subsidize” the project and (2) “the\nvalue of her property has been diminished” by the construction of the project. The\nComptroller does not challenge this argument on appeal.\n      The second element of the test that is set out in Lujan and Data Foundry\nindicates that Franks’s injury must be “fairly traceable” to the actions of the\nComptroller. Data Foundry, 620 S.W.3d at 696; see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560. This\nelement is essential to the analysis because a court can act “only to redress injury\nthat fairly can be traced to the challenged action of the defendant, and not injury that\nresults from the independent action of some third party not before the court.”\nHeckman v. Williamson Cnty., 369 S.W.3d 137, 155 (Tex. 2012) (quoting Simon v.\nE. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 41–42 (1976)).\n      “[T]raceability does not require a defendant’s action to be the sole cause of\nharm.” Grassroots Leadership, Inc. v. Tex. Dep’t of Family & Protective Services,\n646 S.W.3d 815, 820 (Tex. 2022). Rather, an action can also be fairly traceable\nwhen it has a “determinative or coercive effect upon the action of someone else.”\nId. (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997)).\n      In this instance, Franks’s claimed injuries flow out of the alleged misuse of\nher “tax money” and an alleged diminution in the value of her property that\n(according to Franks) resulted from the construction of the project. These claimed\ninjuries are the immediate result of the actions of the school board in approving\nthe tax exemption, not the issuance of a certificate by the Comptroller. See Act of\nMay 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 6, sec. 313.025(b), 2013 Tex. Gen. Laws\n3317, 3321 (expired Dec. 31, 2022); see also Green, 697 S.W.3d at 312 (rejecting\n\n                                          18\n\ftaxpayer’s theory of traceability because “it is the school board—not the\nComptroller—that decides whether to enter a tax-limitation agreement”).\nFurthermore, while the actions of the Comptroller may be one of several remote\ncauses of the alleged injuries, the issuance of the certificate did not have a\n“determinative or coercive effect” upon the actions of the school board, which held\nthe discretion to grant or deny the application, even after the certificate was issued.\nSee Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 6, sec. 313.025(b), 2013 Tex.\nGen. Laws 3317, 3321 (expired Dec. 31, 2022); see Grassroots, 646 S.W.3d at 820.\nAs such, Franks has failed to satisfy the traceability element of the standing test.\n      The third element of the test for standing requires a showing of redressability.\nThat is, Franks must establish a “substantial likelihood that the requested relief will\nremedy the alleged injury.” Heckman, 369 S.W.3d at 155 (quoting Vt. Agency of\nNatural Res. v. U.S. ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 771 (2000)). Thus, for example,\nwhere a plaintiff asserts a claim for injunctive relief, “but the injunction could not\npossibly remedy his situation, then [the plaintiff] lacks standing to bring that claim.”\nId.\n      Franks maintains that she has satisfied the third element because a judgment\ndeclaring the certificate as void would have the effect of “voiding the tax limitation”\nand create a “[r]emoval of [the] tax shield.” However, Franks’s arguments relating\nto the element of redressability are plagued with problems that are similar to her\narguments relating to the element of traceability. Franks did not come to the trial\ncourt with a request to restrain the school district from collecting the taxes at issue.\nShe did not even ask the trial court to declare the value limitation agreement itself\nas void. Instead, she merely sought a declaration that the Comptroller’s certificate\nis void. And while a void certificate might affect the validity of the value limitation\nagreement, and—ultimately—the nature of the taxes that are imposed on the RWP,\n\n                                          19\n\fno relief could be granted by the trial court in connection with the ongoing collection\nof taxes based solely on Franks’s pleadings.\n      We conclude that, because she has failed to satisfy the second and third\nelements of the test enunciated in Lujan and Data Foundry, Franks has failed to\nestablish generalized standing.\n      B. Taxpayer Standing\n      Franks also maintains that, because she has filed “an action to restrain the\nillegal expenditure . . . of tax money,” she has independently established standing as\na taxpayer. See Bland, 34 S.W.3d at 556 (quoting Hoffman, 100 S.W.2d at 96). She\nfurther argues that her standing as a taxpayer exempts her from satisfying the more\ngeneralized elements that are set out in Lujan and Data Foundry. However, the\ncases recognizing the taxpayer standing exception consistently limit its application\nto the first element of the test. See, e.g., Perez v. Turner, 653 S.W.3d 191, 199 (Tex.\n2022) (“Texas law has long recognized an exception to this particularity\nrequirement for taxpayers seeking to ‘enjoin the illegal expenditure of public\nfunds.’” (quoting Bland, 34 S.W.3d at 556) (emphasis added)); Williams, 52 S.W.3d\nat 179 (“Taxpayers in Texas have standing to enjoin the illegal expenditure of public\nfunds, and need not demonstrate a particularized injury.”) (emphasis added); Bland,\n34 S.W.3d at 556 (“a taxpayer has standing to sue in equity to enjoin the illegal\nexpenditure of public funds, even without showing a distinct injury.”) (emphasis\nadded).\n      In Green, the El Paso Court of Appeals addressed the question of whether the\ntaxpayer standing exception supplants the traceability element in a matter that, like\nthis case, involved an effort to void a Comptroller certificate under the Property Act.\n697 S.W.3d at 307. Like Franks, the plaintiffs in Green argued that it was not\nnecessary for the court to determine traceability as a result of their standing as\n\n                                          20\n\ftaxpayers. Id. at 313. However, the court held that “the Landowners’ taxpayer\nstanding argument is responsive to the particularized-injury requirement of standing,\nnot its traceability requirement.” Id. We agree with the El Paso Court of Appeals\nand conclude that a plaintiff claiming taxpayer standing must still satisfy the\ntraceability and redressability elements of Lujan.\n      Because Franks has failed to establish traceability and redressability in\nconnection with her standing claims, we conclude that Franks does not have taxpayer\nstanding.\n      Finally, we note that taxpayer standing cases require a showing of an illegal\nexpenditure of public funds. See, e.g., Williams, 52 S.W.3d at 175 (Plaintiffs were\nseeking, among other things, to enjoin the expenditure of funds to support a\nreligious-education program in the Tarrant County Corrections Center.); Bland,\n34 S.W.3d at 549 (Taxpayers sought to prohibit payment of installments on an\nallegedly illegal lease-purchase agreement.). This principle has been extended to\nlawsuits alleging that the collection of certain taxes was itself illegal. Perez,\n653 S.W.3d at 200 (“[W]hen the allegation is that the tax itself was unauthorized by\nlaw, a plaintiff who paid the tax may rely on taxpayer standing.”). It has also been\nextended to lawsuits alleging that tax funds have been improperly allocated.\nJones v. Turner, 646 S.W.3d 319, 324 (Tex. 2022) (“[W]hen the law requires that a\ncertain amount of money be directed to a specific service, and the plaintiff alleges\nthat it is being directed and spent elsewhere, the taxpayer has alleged an illegal\nexpenditure sufficient to confer taxpayer standing.”). However, it remains unclear\nthat the application of a value limitation agreement can somehow be characterized\nas an “illegal expenditure,” and we do not comment on whether taxpayer standing\nmight otherwise be conferred on Franks in connection with the first element of the\nstanding test.\n\n                                         21\n\f      C. Statutory Standing\n      Franks also alleges that she has statutory standing because the Property Act\npermits a party to bring suit when that party is “affected” by the failure of a\ngovernmental entity to perform an impact assessment that is required by law. See\nGOV’T § 2007.044(a).\n      In this instance, we have already concluded that the Property Act does not\nrequire a takings impact assessment. As such, Franks does not have statutory\nstanding under Section 2007 of the Government Code.\n      D. Conclusion\n      For the reasons stated herein, we overrule Franks’s sole issue on appeal.\n                                   This Court’s Ruling\n       We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                                JOHN M.

See TEX. TAX CODE ANN. §§ 313.001–.171 (West 2015).              Per the\nrequirements of the TEDA at that time, the school district sent a copy of the\n\fapplication to the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts (the Comptroller). See Act\nof May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 6, sec. 313.025(b), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2013 Tex. Gen.\nLaws 3317</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3321 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). The Comptroller then performed an\neconomic impact evaluation and issued a certificate of limitation on appraised value.\nAfter it received the certificate, the school district approved the application.\nThereafter, Appellant, Suzonne Franks, brought suit against the Comptroller’s\noffice, as well as Glenn Hegar, in his official capacity as the Texas Comptroller,\nseeking among other things a declaratory judgment that the certificate was void. The\nComptroller then filed a plea to the jurisdiction. The trial court granted the plea to\nthe jurisdiction, and this appeal followed. We affirm.\n                       The Texas Economic Development Act\n      The TEDA was created to attract manufacturing and other capital-intensive\nprojects to Texas by temporarily limiting taxes that are imposed on new capital\ninvestments. TAX § 313.002. The majority of the Act expired in 2022. TAX\n§ 313.007. However, prior to 2023, the statute provided a means by which property\nowners could apply for limitations on the appraised value of their property. See Act\nof May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304 § 6, sec. 313.025(b-1), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2013 Tex. Gen.\nLaws 3317</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3321–22 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Specifically, the TEDA provided that\n“[t]he owner or lessee of, or the holder of another possessory interest in, any\nqualified property . . . may apply to the governing body of the school district in which\nthe property is located for a limitation on the appraised value.” Act of May 26, 2013,\n83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 6, sec. 313.025(a), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2013 Tex. Gen.

First, the\nComptroller was required to consider whether the project was “reasonably likely to\ngenerate . . . tax revenue” in accordance with certain standards that were set out in\nthe TEDA.

The school district was further authorized to designate an area\nwithin the school district as a reinvestment zone at the same time it granted the\nlimitation on appraised value. TAX § 312.0025(a).\n                                 Background Facts\n      The RWP is a wind energy facility that is located in the easternmost portion\nof Callahan County. Franks filed suit as a resident and landowner in Eastland\n\n                                          4\n\fCounty. She filed the underlying suit in Eastland County alleging that venue was\nproper because the RWP affected her property in Eastland County.\n      On August 24, 2020, the RWP submitted an Application for Appraised Value\nLimitation on Qualified Property to BISD. Thereafter, the school district forwarded\nthe application to the Comptroller.       The application described the “qualified\nproperty” at issue as turbines, a substation, transmission line, and other proposed\nimprovements to the land on which the facility would be located. Likewise, it\nexplicitly indicated that the proposed qualified property would not consist of land.\nThe application also included a letter requesting a partial waiver of the TEDA jobs\nrequirement, indicating that the facility would “create 3 full time permanent\npositions” and that the number of jobs was “congruent with industry standards for\nrenewable energy facilities.”\n      The Comptroller’s analysis showed that the proposed project would likely\ngenerate sufficient tax revenue to offset the losses resulting from the agreement, and\nthat the limitation on appraised value was a “determining factor in the applicant’s\ndecision to invest capital and construct the project.” As such, the Comptroller issued\na certificate for a limitation on the appraised value of the property. Thereafter, on\nFebruary 22, 2021, the school district and the RWP entered into an agreement\nlimiting the appraised value of the property.\n      Franks filed suit against the Comptroller on August 30, 2022, asserting a claim\nunder the Private Real Property Rights Preservation Act (the Property Act). See\nTEX. GOV’T CODE ANN. §§ 2007.001–.045 (West 2016). In her petition, she\ncomplained that the RWP’s application did not meet the statutory requirements to\nbe approved for a tax limitation, and requested a declaratory judgment that the\ncertificate issued for the RWP is void.\n\n\n\n                                          5\n\f      Franks further alleged that the Comptroller’s action in issuing the certificate\nwas an ultra vires act that was attributable to Hegar in his official capacity.

Specifically, Franks argues that,\nbecause the properties that were the subject of the application did not satisfy the\nTEDA’s definition of “qualified properties” at the time the application was\nsubmitted, Hegar was acting without legal authority.\n        The tax limitations that were available under the TEDA were available only\nfor “qualified properties.” See Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 6,\nsec. 313.025, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2013 Tex.

Specifically, Franks asserts that the application did not describe a\n“qualified property” because: (1) it was not located in a reinvestment or enterprise\nzone at the time the certificate was issued, (2) the RWP was not an owner, lessee, or\nholder of any other possessory interest in the property at the time of the application,\nand (3) it did not propose to create at least twenty-five new qualifying jobs.\n      Franks misapprehends the Comptroller’s purpose and role in the approval\nprocess. In issuing the certificate, the Comptroller’s role was limited to undertaking\nthe economic impact analysis, determining whether the project would generate\nsufficient revenue, and ascertaining whether the approval of the exemption would\nbe a determining factor for the RWP. See Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S.,\nch. 1304, § 7, sec. 313.026(c), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3324 (expired Dec. 31,\n2022). By contrast, the Comptroller was not required to consider any of the factors\nthat are enumerated by Franks.\n      The limited role that was played by the Comptroller in issuing the certificate\nis further underscored by our reading of the statute, which contemplates that\nrealization of the statutory requirements described by Franks may not occur until\nafter the parties have entered into an agreement for limitation of value.\n      First, while the TEDA required a property with a limitation on value to be in\na reinvestment or enterprise zone, it did not require that the reinvestment or\n\n                                          9\n\fenterprise zone exist at the time the application was submitted. See Act of May 26,\n2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 3, sec. 313.021(2)(A)(i), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2013 Tex. Gen. Laws\n3317</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3319 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Likewise, it did not require that the zone exist\nat the time a certificate was considered or issued by the Comptroller. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> Instead,\nthe language of the Tax Code indicated that the school district could have first\nrecognized an investment zone at the time the application was granted. Under\nSection 312.0025(a) of the Tax Code, a school district “may designate an area . . . as\na reinvestment zone if the governing body finds that, as a result of the designation\nand the granting of a limitation on appraised value . . . the designation is reasonably\nlikely to . . . contribute to the expansion of primary employment . . . or . . . attract\nmajor investment.”      TAX § 312.0025(a) (emphasis added).             This language\ncontemplated that the “designation and the granting of a limitation” may occur\nsimultaneously. Id. As such, Hegar was not acting ultra vires when he issued a\ncertificate in connection with property that was not yet located in an investment or\nenterprise zone.\n      Franks argues that, because Section 312.0025(a) anticipates future\nemployment and investment, the statute is “forward looking” and that it must\ntherefore, be contemplating that the reinvestment or enterprise zone would exist\nbefore the certificate is issued. This argument is unpersuasive. The realization of\nemployment opportunities and major investment, as described in the statute, need\nnot (and often will not) occur until after the school board gives final approval to the\nproject. As such, the designation of a reinvestment or enterprise zone will almost\nalways be “forward looking,” regardless of whether it occurs before the application\nprocess or at any point during the application process.\n      Second, with respect to Franks’s argument that the RWP was not an owner,\nlessee, or holder of a possessory interest in the property at issue, we note that the\n\n                                          10\n\fTEDA contemplated that the property that was the subject of the application might\nnot exist at the time the application and/or certificate was issued. Specifically, the\nstatute recognized that new improvements and buildings that are “propose[d]” at the\ntime of application constituted qualified property. See Act of May 26, 2013, 83rd\nLeg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 3, sec. 313.021(2)(A)(ii), (B), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2013 Tex. Gen. Laws 3317</span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n3319 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Furthermore, since buildings and improvements, as\nwell as tangible personal property could meet the definition of “qualified property,”\nthe applicant was not required to hold a possessory interest in the land itself at any\ntime, much less at the time the certificate is issued by the Comptroller. See Act of\nMay 26, 2013, 83rd Leg., R.S., ch. 1304, § 3, sec. 313.021(2), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2013 Tex. Gen. Laws\n3317</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3319 (expired Dec. 31, 2022). Accordingly, we likewise conclude that Hegar\nwas not acting ultra vires when he issued a certificate in connection with proposed\nownership of improvements.\n      Finally, we note that, because the school district ultimately had the authority\nto waive or alter the statutory jobs requirements, and because the application itself\nindicated that a waiver was requested, Hegar was not acting ultra vires based on the\napplication’s failure to signal that the project would not create twenty-five jobs. See\nAct of May 22, 2007, 80th Leg., R.S., ch. 864, § 3, sec. 313.025(f-1), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2007 Tex.\nGen.

The “governmental actions” that\nare subject to the Property Act are subdivided into the following four categories:\n            (1) the adoption or issuance of an ordinance, rule, regulatory\n      requirement, resolution, policy, guideline, or similar measure;\n\n            (2) an action that imposes a physical invasion or requires a\n      dedication or exaction of private real property;\n\n             (3) an action by a municipality that has effect in the\n      extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality, excluding annexation,\n      and that enacts or enforces an ordinance, rule, regulation, or plan that\n      does not impose identical requirements or restrictions in the entire\n      extraterritorial jurisdiction of the municipality; and\n             (4) enforcement of a governmental action listed in Subdivisions\n      (1) through (3), whether the enforcement of the governmental action is\n      accomplished through the use of permitting, citations, orders, judicial\n      or quasi-judicial proceedings, or other similar means.\nGOV’T § 2007.003(a).      A takings impact analysis is required for categories\n(1) through (3), but not for category (4). GOV’T § 2007.043(a). If a governmental\nentity fails to conduct the takings impact, an affected private real property owner\n                                         12\n\f“may bring suit for a declaration of the invalidity of the governmental action.”\nGOV’T § 2007.044(a).\n      The Comptroller asserts that, when it issued the certificate, it was not engaged\nin a “governmental action” that falls within one of the first three categories\nin Section 2007.003(a).    Franks disagrees, arguing that the issuance of the\ncertificate was a “regulatory requirement, resolution, . . . or similar measure” under\nSection 2007.003(a)(1).\n      We conclude that the Comptroller’s action in issuing a certificate was\nnot a “regulatory requirement, resolution, . . . or similar measure” under\nSection 2007.003(a)(1).

Second, she argues that she\nhas standing to bring suit as a taxpayer under the standards set out in Bland.

Franks did not come to the trial\ncourt with a request to restrain the school district from collecting the taxes at issue.\nShe did not even ask the trial court to declare the value limitation agreement itself\nas void. Instead, she merely sought a declaration that the Comptroller’s certificate\nis void.

Like Franks, the plaintiffs in Green argued that it was not\nnecessary for the court to determine traceability as a result of their standing as\n\n                                          20\n\ftaxpayers.

We agree with the El Paso Court of Appeals\nand conclude that a plaintiff claiming taxpayer standing must still satisfy the\ntraceability and redressability elements of Lujan.\n      Because Franks has failed to establish traceability and redressability in\nconnection with her standing claims, we conclude that Franks does not have taxpayer\nstanding.\n      Finally, we note that taxpayer standing cases require a showing of an illegal\nexpenditure of public funds.

Pursuant to\nRule 7.1(a)(1) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, we will proceed to adjudicate the appeal as if\nBurt were still alive and will identify Burt as Appellee. See TEX. R. APP. P. 7.1(a)(1).\n\fof land (the property). In two issues, U.S. Gypsum challenges (1) the trial court’s\nsubject-matter jurisdiction and (2) the trial court’s denial of its motion for new trial,\nwhich sought to set aside the default judgment. We reverse and render.\n                           Factual and Procedural History\n      This suit arises from litigation filed in a probate proceeding. On June 6, 2018,\nSheila Rhea Burnett (Sheila) filed an application to probate S. Dale Burnett’s (Dale)\nwill in the Nolan County Court, alleging that Dale passed away on March 9, 2018.\nOn July 25, 2023, Sheila and Dale’s son, Burt, moved to transfer the probate case\nunder Section 32.004 of the Texas Estates Code to the 1st Multicounty Court at Law\nof Nolan County. See TEX. EST. CODE ANN. § 32.004 (West 2020). The county court\ngranted the transfer on August 8, 2023.\n      Burt filed his live pleading in this matter on September 19, 2023, against U.S.\nGypsum asserting claims of trespass to try title, to quiet title, and to obtain\ndeclaratory relief. Burt alleged that on July 31, 2012, over five years before his\nfather’s death, Burt acquired the property via general warranty deed from his parents:\nDale and Sheila. That deed was filed in the Nolan County Clerk’s Office on July 31,\n2012. Burt allowed his family to continue using and enjoying the property, which\nincluded allowing his brother and nephew to dispose of scrap tires, metal, and\nplastic waste on the northern part of the property, next to Sweetwater Creek. On\nFebruary 22, 2022, however, U.S. Gypsum filed suit in the 32nd District Court of\nNolan County against Burt’s brother and nephew to recover costs, alleging\nownership of the property and asserting claims for negligence, trespass, and\nnuisance. The parties in the district court litigation agreed to the entry of an\ninjunction.\n      On November 9, 2023, Burt moved in the transferred probate proceeding for\na no-answer default judgment against U.S. Gypsum. The trial court granted Burt’s\n\n\n                                           2\n\fmotion and signed a default judgment on November 30, 2023. U.S. Gypsum filed a\nmotion for new trial on December 20, 2023, alleging that its failure to answer was\nthe result of the registered agent e-mailing notice of service to a paralegal who, at\nthe time, was on medical leave for brain cancer. U.S. Gypsum also alleged that it\nwas the owner of the land in question, and it provided supporting exhibits, including\na 1923 deed from U.S. Gypsum’s purchase, a title report, and property tax statements\nof receipt. U.S. Gypsum also alleged that the attorney representing Burt in the\n1st Multicounty Court at Law also represented Burt’s brother in the ongoing lawsuit\nin the district court regarding the same property. U.S. Gypsum alleged that the\nattorney had not contacted U.S. Gypsum about this second suit until after a default\njudgment was taken, even though it had been in communication with the attorney’s\noffice during that period to schedule depositions in the district court case.\n      Burt opposed the motion for new trial, arguing that U.S. Gypsum received\nnotice of the suit through its registered agent, as acknowledged by U.S. Gypsum in\nits motion. Burt broadly argued that “US Gypsum wholly fail[ed] to plead facts or\npresent any competent evidence that would support the first element of the Craddock\nTest.” See Craddock v. Sunshine Bus Lines, Inc., 133 S.W.2d 124, 126 (Tex. 1939).\nBurt similarly asserted that U.S. Gypsum failed to satisfy the remaining two\nelements of the Craddock test. Id. Burt moved to strike the affidavit of Brad Nerad,\nU.S. Gypsum’s assistant general counsel, on the basis that Nerad did not specifically\nstate in the affidavit that the facts he relied upon were within his personal knowledge.\n      The trial court sustained Burt’s objections, struck Nerad’s affidavit, and\ndenied U.S. Gypsum’s motion for new trial.\n      U.S. Gypsum asserts in its first issue that the 1st Multicounty Court at Law\nlacked subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate Burt’s claims for the recovery of real\nproperty. In a nutshell, U.S. Gypsum contends that, despite Burt’s attempt to cast\n\n\n                                           3\n\fhis lawsuit as a probate proceeding, the 1st Multicounty Court at Law lacked subject-\nmatter jurisdiction to adjudicate a title dispute to real property, and that the action\ncould only have been brought in district court.\n                                 Standard of Review\n      “[S]ubject-matter jurisdiction is never presumed and cannot be waived.” Tex.\nDep’t of Transp. v.

TEX. CONST.\nart. V, § 8; GOV’T § 24.007(a) (West 2023). District courts are presumed to have\nsubject-matter jurisdiction unless otherwise shown; “[t]hus, all claims are presumed\nto fall within the jurisdiction of the district court unless the Legislature or Congress\nhas provided that they must be heard elsewhere.” Dubai Petroleum Co. v. Kazi,\n12 S.W.3d 71, 75 (Tex. 2000).\n      The 1st Multicounty Court at Law’s specific jurisdictional statute,\nSection 25.2702, provides that, “[i]n addition to the jurisdiction provided by\nSection 25.0003,” the court has concurrent jurisdiction with the district court,\nbut only in family law cases and proceedings and in felony criminal cases. GOV’T\n§ 25.2702(a) (West Supp. 2024); see id. 25.0003(a) (noting that statutory county\ncourts have jurisdiction over the same causes and proceedings as constitutional\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fcounty courts 2); id. § 26.042 (setting out civil jurisdiction for constitutional county\ncourts). Because Section 25.2702 does not provide that the court has concurrent\njurisdiction with the district court in civil cases up to a certain amount in controversy,\nnor does it otherwise confer jurisdiction over real property title disputes, the\n1st Multicounty Court at Law is subject to the county courts’ jurisdictional\nlimitations set forth in Section 26.043. See GOV’T § 26.043 (West 2019); cf. Ditech\nServicing, LLC v. Perez, 669 S.W.3d 188, 194 (Tex. 2023) (“[T]he limitations on\ncounty courts necessarily apply to county courts at law” absent an independent\njurisdictional grant.); compare GOV’T § 25.1102 (Hidalgo County Court at Law has\nconcurrent jurisdiction with the district court in civil cases in which the matter in\ncontroversy does not exceed $750,000, regardless of type.), with 25.2702 (1st\nMulticounty Court at Law only has concurrent jurisdiction with the district court in\nfamily law cases and proceedings and in felony criminal cases.). Consequently, the\n1st Multicounty Court at Law, like other statutory county courts, does not have\njurisdiction to determine real property title disputes. See GOV’T § 26.043(8) (county\ncourts lack jurisdiction over suits for the recovery of land); Ditech Servicing,\n669 S.W.3d at 191, 194; In re Riley, 339 S.W.3d 216, 220 (Tex.

EST.\n§ 22.017 (defining “independent executor”). Ordinarily, the personal representative\nof the estate of a decedent is the only person entitled to sue for the recovery of\nproperty belonging to the estate. Moody v.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, no pet.). There, the\ncourt noted that the county court lacked jurisdiction over the plaintiff’s claim\nbecause it was solely for money damages and did not seek title to “property that is\nestate property.” Id. at 810; see EST. § 22.012(1) (defining “estate”); Mariner Health\nCare of Nashville, Inc. v. Robins, 321 S.W.3d 193, 200–01 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\nDist.] 2010, no pet.) (“When a person dies, all of the decedent’s real and personal\nproperty become part of an estate, including any actual or potential cause of\naction.”).   The Twelfth Court of Appeals held similarly and concluded that\nSection 31.002 did not expand the county court’s jurisdiction to cover non-probate\nassets. In re Est. of Rushing, 644 S.W.3d 383, 388 (Tex. App.—Tyler 2022, pet.\ndenied) (determining that the county court lacked jurisdiction to create constructive\ntrust for a life insurance policy). The reasoning of the court in Estate of Rushing is\ninstructive because, as here, “this is not a claim against the personal representative\nor his surety based on the performance of his duties in his capacity as personal\nrepresentative, nor is it a claim brought on behalf of an estate for trial of title to real\nproperty or other estate property.” Id. at 388.\n      A probate court may exercise pendent and ancillary jurisdiction over non-\nprobate claims as necessary to promote judicial efficiency and economy.

The fundamental question when reviewing a probate court’s\nexercise of pendant and ancillary jurisdiction is whether there was a close\nrelationship between the non-probate claims and the probate proceeding such that\nthe probate court’s exercise of jurisdiction will aid it in the efficient administration\nof the estate. Id. (citing Schuchmann v. Schuchmann, 193 S.W.3d 598, 603 (Tex.\nApp.—Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied)). “A probate court has jurisdiction ‘to resolve\nancillary claims against third parties only to the extent that such claims were\nnecessary to resolve claims within its original jurisdiction.’”           Id. (quoting\nGoodman v. Summit at W. Rim, Ltd., 952 S.W.2d 930, 934 (Tex. App.—Austin 1997,\nno pet.)).\n                                       Analysis\n       U.S. Gypsum argues that, while subsections 31.002(a)(5) and (6) of the\nEstates Code require that the property be “estate property,” the disputed tract is not\nestate property because the property was allegedly obtained by Burt in 2012, over\nfive years before Dale passed away. Burt advances three arguments for his position\nthat the 1st Multicounty Court at Law possessed jurisdiction over his claims:\n(1) subsections 31.002(a)(3), (5), and (6) provide the trial court with jurisdiction;\n(2) Section 31.002’s use of the word “including” before the enumerated items makes\nit a non-exhaustive list; and (3) the trial court possessed pendant and ancillary\njurisdiction because if U.S. Gypsum “were to prevail on its assertion and have a\ndeclaration that the 2012 Deed to [Burt] is void, the issue of title to the Property\nremains.” U.S. Gypsum counters by pointing out that subsection 31.002(a)(3)\nprovides jurisdiction for suits brought by the estate’s personal representative—\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fwhich has not happened here 3—and that the trial court lacked pendant and ancillary\njurisdiction because Burt’s suit does not involve the settlement, partition, or\ndistribution of Dale’s estate. For the reasons stated below, we agree with U.S.\nGypsum.\n        First, subsection 31.002(a)(3) provides for jurisdiction for “a claim brought\nby a personal representative on behalf of an estate.” EST. § 31.002(a)(3). It is\nundisputed that Sheila is the personal representative of Dale’s estate. However, it\nwas not Sheila, individually or in her capacity as personal representative, that\nbrought the claim; rather, it was Burt. Accordingly, subsection 31.002(a)(3) is\ninapplicable and does not provide the 1st Multicounty Court at Law with subject-\nmatter jurisdiction to hear and decide this case. See EST. 31.002(a)(3); Abdullatif,\n460 S.W.3d at 691.\n        Further, Burt’s own pleadings defeat the trial court’s jurisdiction under\nsubsection 31.002(a)(5) and (6). See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 226–27; Abdullatif,\n460 S.W.3d at 691. According to Burt’s live pleading, his first amended petition, he\nallegedly acquired title to the disputed property from Sheila and Dale in 2012,\nover five years before Dale’s death and the probate of his estate. As used in\nsubsections 31.002(a)(5) and (6), the term “estate property” refers to property owned\nby the decedent at the time of his death and subject to distribution through probate.\nSee EST. § 31.002(a)(5), (6); GOV’T § 311.011; Belew, 692 S.W.3d at 362. Burt’s\npleading makes no allegation that Sheila, neither individually nor as the executor of\nthe estate, ever claimed that the property was part of the estate or had not been\nconveyed to Burt in 2012, or contended that there was any reversion of that\nconveyance. Importantly, Burt prayed for no declaration as to the estate, and sought\n\n\n        3\n          Moreover, it appears that Burt was not a beneficiary of the estate in that Dale’s will bequeathed\nall of his estate assets to Shelia, who survived him.\n\n\n                                                    11\n\fno damages or remedy from it. As such, the disputed property is not “estate\nproperty” as Burt suggests, according to his own pleadings. See EST. § 31.002(a)(5),\n(6); In re Hannah, 431 S.W.3d at 810 (holding that the plaintiff did not seek “estate\nproperty” when they sought monetary damages from individual defendants, not the\nestate); see also D’Olivio v. Hutson, No. 05-20-00969-CV, 2022 WL 2800836, at *2\n(Tex. App.—Dallas July 18, 2022, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (holding that because the\nproperty was conveyed before the decedent’s death, “[t]he property, therefore,\npassed outside of the estate and is not a part of, or related to, the probate proceeding”)\n(citing Wallace v. Wallace, No. 05-17-00447-CV, 2017 WL 4479653, at *4 (Tex.\nApp.—Dallas Oct. 9, 2017, no pet.) (mem. op.) (probate court did not have exclusive\njurisdiction where former wife was seeking to partition property as a tenant in\ncommon and not as an heir)). As such, subsections 31.002(a)(5) and (6) are\ninapplicable and do not afford the trial court subject-matter jurisdiction to hear and\ndecide the case. See EST. § 31.002(a)(5), (6); Abdullatif, 460 S.W.3d at 691.\n      We need not directly opine as to Burt’s argument that Section 31.002’s use of\nthe word “including” before the enumerated items establishes a non-exhaustive list\nbecause Burt’s claims are not otherwise “related to a probate proceeding.” See EST.\n§ 31.002(a); see also GOV’T § 311.005(13) (“‘Includes’ and ‘including’ are terms of\nenlargement and not of limitation or exclusive enumeration, and use of the terms\ndoes not create a presumption that components not expressed are excluded.”). Burt\nrelies on decisions from three of our sister courts to support his position that his suit\nis “related to a probate proceeding”; however, those cases are inapposite for the\nreasons explained below.\n      In Saenz v. Saenz, the decedent executed a will in 1986 and executed three\ndeeds relating to real property within the will in 1987, 1988, and 1992. 49 S.W.3d\n447, 448 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2001, no pet.). Plaintiffs, presumably those who\n\n\n                                           12\n\fpurchased or received the three deeds, filed suit against the estate’s independent\nexecutor. Id. The procedural and factual history of this case is scant, but a dispute\narose whether the estate was the owner of the property or the other individuals. Id.\nat 448–49. The Fourth Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s dismissal of\nthe plaintiffs’ petition, holding that “[t]itle to the land conveyed both by [the\ndecedent]’s will and by subsequent deeds is a matter appertaining to [the decedent]’s\nestate.” Id. at 449. Thus, this case involved a dispute as to whether the estate owned\nthe property such that it could distribute it. See id. at 448–49.\n      In In re Frank Schuster Farms, Incorporated, a dispute arose relating to tracts\nof land that heirs believed to have been owned by Schuster Farms, a corporation.\nNo. 13-10-00225-CV, 2010 WL 2638481, at *1 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi–\nEdinburg June 29, 2010, no pet.) (mem. op.).           The decedent had previously\ntransferred several tracts of land that he owned individually to Schuster Farms but\nnot all. Id. After the decedent passed, his estate was divided amongst his heirs, his\nthree children, and settled by arbitration. Id. However, sometime later, the heirs\ndiscovered that a portion of the property had not been distributed under the estate\neven though it was owned by decedent individually because they had believed that\nit belonged to the corporation. Id. One of their heirs filed suit in the probate court,\nwhich transferred it to the district court at the motion of the executor. Id. The\nThirteenth Court of Appeals held that the probate court, not the district court, had\njurisdiction because, although the property was not distributed in the original\nprobate, it should have been, and thus an ownership dispute existed between the\ncorporation, estate, and would-be heirs. Id. at *6. Accordingly, the property was\n“estate property” because the decedent owned the property at the time of his death,\nand it was subject to distribution through his estate, regardless of the heirs mistaken\nbelief that it was owned by Schuster Farms. See id. at 6–7.\n\n\n                                          13\n\f      In Barton v. Buchanan, a property-line dispute arose between two tracts of\nland owned by two brothers who had since passed. No. 03-02-00596-CV, 2003\nWL 21939725, at *1 (Tex. App.—Austin Aug. 14, 2003, no pet.) (mem. op.). The\nbrothers acquired the two adjoining tracts, which had been subdivided, and merged\nthem into common ownership where each brother held an undivided one-half\ninterest. Id. The brothers later executed a partition deed, again splitting the property\nin two, with each brother taking one half. Id. After their passing and during the\nadministration of their estates, a dispute arose regarding the property line separating\nthe two tracts. Id. While the estates were pending, one of the heirs filed a trespass-\nto-try-title suit in a statutory county court. Id. The Third Court of Appeals held that\nthe statutory county court possessed jurisdiction to determine the trespass-to-try-title\nsuit, despite the fact that the properties had already been distributed to the heirs,\nbecause the heirs received the property through probate and each estate “ostensibly\nsought to distribute the same piece of property to different heirs” through probate.\nId. at *3–4. Accordingly, this property was also “estate property.”\n      Because each of these cases involved “estate property,” they do not support\nBurt’s contention that his suit is nonetheless “related to a probate proceeding.” See\nEST. § 31.002(a). To be clear, Burt’s suit filed in the 1st Multicounty Court at Law\ndoes not identify any circumstance that would impact the estate as his pleadings\nallege that the property belongs to him individually. None of his pleaded causes of\naction nor his requested relief would affect the estate or its distribution and\nsettlement; resolution of his suit requires no involvement from or impact to the\nestate. See id.\n      Finally, Burt argues that the trial court possessed pendant and ancillary\njurisdiction because if U.S. Gypsum succeeded on a claim that Burt’s 2012 deed was\nvoid, the issue of title to the property remains. Burt argues that “[t]rying the\n\n\n                                          14\n\fboundary line dispute and the validity of the 2012 Deed in one lawsuit no doubt\npromotes judicial efficiency and economy.”           These arguments do not confer\njurisdiction on the 1st Multicounty Court at Law to hear his claims that, by his own\npleadings, do not relate to the estate. Nothing in the pleadings indicate that the\nboundary line dispute would be against the estate. See Abdullatif, 460 S.W.3d at 691\n(holding that a party must file pleadings that affirmatively demonstrate the trial\ncourt’s subject-matter jurisdiction). Moreover, if Burt were to succeed on his claims,\nhe would be the owner of the property, not the estate; similarly, if he failed,\nU.S. Gypsum would have superior title to the property, not the estate. See TEX. CIV.\nPRAC. & REM. CODE § 37.004(a) (West 2020) (A person with rights under a deed,\ncontract, or instrument “may have determined any question of construction or\nvalidity arising under the instrument . . . and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or\nother legal relations thereunder.”); Essex Crane Rental Corp. v. Carter, 371 S.W.3d\n366, 388 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2012, pet. denied) (“A suit to clear title or\nquiet title—also known as a suit to remove cloud from title—relies on the invalidity\nof the defendant’s claim to the property.”); MEI Camp Springs, LLC v. Clear Fork,\nInc., 623 S.W.3d 83, 90 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2021, no pet.) (“The plaintiff in a\ntrespass to try title action is required to prove its title by proving (1) a regular chain\nof conveyances from the sovereign to the plaintiff, (2) a superior title to that of the\ndefendant out of a common source, (3) title by limitations, or (4) prior possession\nthat has not been abandoned.”). Accordingly, Burt’s claims do not bear a close\nrelationship with the probate proceeding such that the probate court’s jurisdiction\nwould aid in the efficient administration of the estate. See Hallmark, 629 S.W.3d at\n438.\n       Because Burt’s claimed grounds for jurisdiction in the 1st Multicounty Court\nat Law do not apply to the claims or disputes at hand, we sustain U.S. Gypsum’s first\n\n\n                                           15\n\fissue; it is the district court that has exclusive jurisdiction to determine this action.\nSee TEX.

V, § 8; GOV’T § 26.043 (8) (“A county court does not have\njurisdiction in a suit for the recovery of land.”); Chambers, 241 S.W.3d at 684.\nBecause the 1st Multicounty Court at Law lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to hear\nand decide this case, its default judgment in favor of Burt is void and must be set\naside. As such, we need not address U.S. Gypsum’s second issue in which it\nargues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying its motion for new trial.\nSee TEX. R. APP.

Pursuant to\nRule 7.1(a)(1) of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, we will proceed to adjudicate the appeal as if\nBurt were still alive and will identify Burt as Appellee. See TEX. R. APP.

In two issues, U.S. Gypsum challenges (1) the trial court’s\nsubject-matter jurisdiction and (2) the trial court’s denial of its motion for new trial,\nwhich sought to set aside the default judgment. We reverse and render.\n                           Factual and Procedural History\n      This suit arises from litigation filed in a probate proceeding. On June 6, 2018,\nSheila Rhea Burnett (Sheila) filed an application to probate S. Dale Burnett’s (Dale)\nwill in the Nolan County Court, alleging that Dale passed away on March 9, 2018.\nOn July 25, 2023, Sheila and Dale’s son, Burt, moved to transfer the probate case\nunder Section 32.004 of the Texas Estates Code to the 1st Multicounty Court at Law\nof Nolan County. See TEX. EST. CODE ANN. § 32.004 (West 2020). The county court\ngranted the transfer on August 8, 2023.\n      Burt filed his live pleading in this matter on September 19, 2023, against U.S.\nGypsum asserting claims of trespass to try title, to quiet title, and to obtain\ndeclaratory relief. Burt alleged that on July 31, 2012, over five years before his\nfather’s death, Burt acquired the property via general warranty deed from his parents:\nDale and Sheila. That deed was filed in the Nolan County Clerk’s Office on July 31,\n2012. Burt allowed his family to continue using and enjoying the property, which\nincluded allowing his brother and nephew to dispose of scrap tires, metal, and\nplastic waste on the northern part of the property, next to Sweetwater Creek. On\nFebruary 22, 2022, however, U.S. Gypsum filed suit in the 32nd District Court of\nNolan County against Burt’s brother and nephew to recover costs, alleging\nownership of the property and asserting claims for negligence, trespass, and\nnuisance. The parties in the district court litigation agreed to the entry of an\ninjunction.\n      On November 9, 2023, Burt moved in the transferred probate proceeding for\na no-answer default judgment against U.S. Gypsum. The trial court granted Burt’s\n\n\n                                           2\n\fmotion and signed a default judgment on November 30, 2023. U.S. Gypsum filed a\nmotion for new trial on December 20, 2023, alleging that its failure to answer was\nthe result of the registered agent e-mailing notice of service to a paralegal who, at\nthe time, was on medical leave for brain cancer. U.S. Gypsum also alleged that it\nwas the owner of the land in question, and it provided supporting exhibits, including\na 1923 deed from U.S. Gypsum’s purchase, a title report, and property tax statements\nof receipt. U.S. Gypsum also alleged that the attorney representing Burt in the\n1st Multicounty Court at Law also represented Burt’s brother in the ongoing lawsuit\nin the district court regarding the same property. U.S. Gypsum alleged that the\nattorney had not contacted U.S. Gypsum about this second suit until after a default\njudgment was taken, even though it had been in communication with the attorney’s\noffice during that period to schedule depositions in the district court case.\n      Burt opposed the motion for new trial, arguing that U.S. Gypsum received\nnotice of the suit through its registered agent, as acknowledged by U.S. Gypsum in\nits motion. Burt broadly argued that “US Gypsum wholly fail[ed] to plead facts or\npresent any competent evidence that would support the first element of the Craddock\nTest.” See Craddock v. Sunshine Bus Lines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3940166\"><a href=\"/opinion/4172687/craddock-v-sunshine-bus-lines-inc/#126\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Craddock v.

Burt advances three arguments for his position\nthat the 1st Multicounty Court at Law possessed jurisdiction over his claims:\n(1) subsections 31.002(a)(3), (5), and (6) provide the trial court with jurisdiction;\n(2) Section 31.002’s use of the word “including” before the enumerated items makes\nit a non-exhaustive list; and (3) the trial court possessed pendant and ancillary\njurisdiction because if U.S. Gypsum “were to prevail on its assertion and have a\ndeclaration that the 2012 Deed to [Burt] is void, the issue of title to the Property\nremains.” U.S. Gypsum counters by pointing out that subsection 31.002(a)(3)\nprovides jurisdiction for suits brought by the estate’s personal representative—\n\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\fwhich has not happened here 3—and that the trial court lacked pendant and ancillary\njurisdiction because Burt’s suit does not involve the settlement, partition, or\ndistribution of Dale’s estate. For the reasons stated below, we agree with U.S.\nGypsum.\n        First, subsection 31.002(a)(3) provides for jurisdiction for “a claim brought\nby a personal representative on behalf of an estate.” EST. § 31.002(a)(3). It is\nundisputed that Sheila is the personal representative of Dale’s estate. However, it\nwas not Sheila, individually or in her capacity as personal representative, that\nbrought the claim; rather, it was Burt. Accordingly, subsection 31.002(a)(3) is\ninapplicable and does not provide the 1st Multicounty Court at Law with subject-\nmatter jurisdiction to hear and decide this case.

According to Burt’s live pleading, his first amended petition, he\nallegedly acquired title to the disputed property from Sheila and Dale in 2012,\nover five years before Dale’s death and the probate of his estate. As used in\nsubsections 31.002(a)(5) and (6), the term “estate property” refers to property owned\nby the decedent at the time of his death and subject to distribution through probate.\nSee EST. § 31.002(a)(5), (6); GOV’T § 311.011; Belew, 692 S.W.3d at 362. Burt’s\npleading makes no allegation that Sheila, neither individually nor as the executor of\nthe estate, ever claimed that the property was part of the estate or had not been\nconveyed to Burt in 2012, or contended that there was any reversion of that\nconveyance. Importantly, Burt prayed for no declaration as to the estate, and sought\n\n\n        3\n          Moreover, it appears that Burt was not a beneficiary of the estate in that Dale’s will bequeathed\nall of his estate assets to Shelia, who survived him.\n\n\n                                                    11\n\fno damages or remedy from it.

Accordingly, this property was also “estate property.”\n      Because each of these cases involved “estate property,” they do not support\nBurt’s contention that his suit is nonetheless “related to a probate proceeding.” See\nEST. § 31.002(a). To be clear, Burt’s suit filed in the 1st Multicounty Court at Law\ndoes not identify any circumstance that would impact the estate as his pleadings\nallege that the property belongs to him individually. None of his pleaded causes of\naction nor his requested relief would affect the estate or its distribution and\nsettlement; resolution of his suit requires no involvement from or impact to the\nestate.

BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge. In this interlocutory appeal, Matthew Simon,\na local housing-code official, argues that qualified immunity shields him from suit on Belinda\nFitzpatrick’s claims under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court denied\nSimon’s motion to dismiss after it determined that, based on the facts alleged, Simon had\nplausibly violated Fitzpatrick’s clearly established constitutional rights. For the reasons below,\nwe reverse.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       Belinda Fitzpatrick owns two adjacent homes in Lansing, Michigan, which is located in\nIngham County. Sometime in September 2021, Ingham County Animal Control received a\ncomplaint that Fitzpatrick had “up to 30 chickens being harbored” in these two adjacent homes,\nand that she had been subjecting the chickens to “unsanitary living conditions.” So, given these\nallegations, Animal Control dispatched Officer Kyle Hanney to speak with Fitzpatrick and\ninvestigate the claims against her.\n\n       After Officer Hanney and Fitzpatrick spent several minutes discussing her chickens,\nFitzpatrick agreed to let Officer Hanney look inside one of her houses. But Fitzpatrick asked\nOfficer Hanney “not to call Lansing City Code Compliance” about anything he saw because she\nwas afraid that both houses “would be condemned” if a city official saw “the inside living\nconditions.”   Officer Hanney then entered one of Fitzpatrick’s houses and immediately\nencountered a “very strong odor of ammonia” that made it “difficult [for him] to breath[e].” Not\nonly that, but Officer Hanney also observed that the house was “extremely cluttered with\npersonal belongings that were coated in what appeared to be chicken feces.” In fact, the house\ncontained so much chicken feces that Officer Hanney could not move around the house without\nwalking through the feces. Outside the home, Officer Hanney observed chickens running around\nthe backyard of Fitzpatrick’s other property in seemingly hazardous conditions.\n\f No. 24-1639                         Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                            Page 3\n\n\n       Based on what he saw, Officer Hanney successfully requested and obtained a warrant to\nsearch both of Fitzpatrick’s homes for evidence of “crimes of animal neglect and cruelty,”\nincluding “[a]ny and all living or deceased animals” and “[a]ny and all animals subjected to\nunsanitary/unsafe living conditions.”      But before returning to Fitzpatrick’s homes with the\nwarrant, Officer Hanney reached out to Matthew Simon, a local housing-code official, and\ninvited Simon to join him and his team in their search of the homes. Simon agreed to do so, and\nafter visiting Fitzpatrick’s two homes and seeing their condition, he concluded that both were\n“unfit for human occupancy” and immediately placed a “red tag” on each one. These red tags\nprohibited Fitzpatrick (or anyone else) from entering the homes until they had been thoroughly\ncleaned.\n\n       Two years later, Fitzpatrick sued Officer Hanney, Simon, and the City of Lansing,\nalleging that they had each violated her constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment, and\nthat Simon and the City had each also violated her rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nSimon then moved to dismiss based on qualified immunity. The district court denied Simon’s\nmotion to dismiss after it concluded that, based on the facts alleged, Simon had plausibly\nviolated Fitzpatrick’s clearly established constitutional rights.         This interlocutory appeal\nfollowed.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n       Qualified immunity shields government officials from suit unless those officials\n(1) violated a constitutional right that (2) was clearly established when the conduct occurred.\nBell v. City of Southfield, 37 F.4th 362, 367 (6th Cir. 2022). Proving that a constitutional right is\nclearly established is no easy task, however, and doing so requires a plaintiff to show that two\nthings are true. First, the rule establishing the right must be “settled,” meaning that it is “dictated\nby controlling authority” and not merely “suggested by then-existing precedent.” District of\nColumbia v. Wesby, 583 U.S. 48, 63 (2018). And second, the rule must “clearly prohibit the\n[official’s] conduct in the particular circumstances before him.” Id. It is not enough, in other\nwords, for the plaintiff to identify a case that “merely stand[s] for [a] general proposition.” Bell,\n37 F.4th at 367. Read together, these two principles require that the precedent be “clear enough\nthat every reasonable official would interpret it to establish the particular rule the plaintiff seeks\n\f No. 24-1639                       Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                       Page 4\n\n\nto apply.” Wesby, 583 U.S. at 63. In deciding qualified immunity defenses, we can address these\ntwo prongs in either order. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 236 (2009).\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       Here, Fitzpatrick maintains that Simon violated her clearly established constitutional\nrights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments when he searched her two homes for\nhousing-code violations without a warrant for those violations and then proceeded to evict her\nfrom both homes without notice. We disagree and address each issue in turn.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       The Fourth Amendment guarantees “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their\npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches.” U.S. Const. amend. IV. At\nits core, this guarantee means that unless an exception applies, a government search will be\nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment if the government does not have a valid search\nwarrant. See, e.g., United States v. McLevain, 310 F.3d 434, 438 (6th Cir. 2002). While this\nprinciple most often applies to searches conducted by police officers, it also applies to\ngovernment officials who perform administrative searches for housing-code violations. Hill v.\nWhitford, No. 20-2076, 2021 WL 3661325, at *2 (6th Cir. Aug. 18, 2021); see also City of Los\nAngeles v. Patel, 576 U.S. 409, 419-20 (2015).\n\n       Relying on these principles, Fitzpatrick argues here that Simon violated her clearly\nestablished rights under the Fourth Amendment when he searched her home without a separate\nwarrant for housing-code violations. Although Fitzpatrick concedes, as she must, that Officer\nHanney received a valid warrant to search her home for evidence of animal neglect, she\nmaintains that this warrant did not extend to Simon—a government official from a different\nagency searching her home for different violations. We disagree.\n\n       This court has never held that the Fourth Amendment categorically prohibits joint\nsearches between two government officials when both officials rely on the same search warrant.\nTo the contrary, in United States v. Garcia, we summarized decades of precedent and concluded\nthat the Fourth Amendment allows such searches unless (1) the second official “had probable\n\f No. 24-1639                         Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                         Page 5\n\n\ncause to obtain a separate warrant,” (2) the second official “had an opportunity but failed to\nobtain a separate warrant,” and (3) the second official “was searching for items different from\nthose authorized” by the first official’s warrant. 496 F.3d 495, 509 (6th Cir. 2007). These three\nconditions are in the conjunctive.\n\n       And Garcia remains the rule today. Indeed, several years ago, this court reaffirmed\nGarcia and held that federal law enforcement officers in Michigan could rely on a search warrant\nissued to state law enforcement officers in Texas “so long as they [were] searching for the same\nevidence as the state officers and the same evidence authorized by the state warrant.” United\nStates v. Castro, 881 F.3d 961, 967 (6th Cir. 2018).\n\n       To be sure, this court has not yet decided whether the Fourth Amendment allows\ngovernment officials such as Simon to search a home using a warrant obtained by a different\nofficial when both officials are looking for the same conditions, as opposed to items or evidence.\nBut given the decisions that we do have, we conclude that Simon is entitled to qualified\nimmunity on Fitzpatrick’s Fourth Amendment claims because it was not clearly established then\n(or now) that Simon was “searching for items different from those authorized” by Officer\nHanney’s warrant.     Garcia, 496 F.3d at 509.         In other words, we cannot say that “every\nreasonable official” who reads Garcia and Castro would understand those decisions to mean that\nthe Fourth Amendment allows two government officials to search a home for the same items or\nevidence but does not also allow them to search a home for the same conditions. Wesby, 583\nU.S. at 63.\n\n       To argue otherwise, Fitzpatrick identifies two cases that she believes clearly established\nthe unconstitutionality of Simon’s conduct. First, Fitzpatrick relies on our decision in Gardner v.\nEvans, which held that a housing-code official could not, under the Fourth Amendment, search a\nhome for housing-code violations based on a warrant issued to police officers that allowed them\nto search that same home for drugs. 920 F.3d 1038, 1053 (6th Cir. 2019). But Gardner did not\nestablish, as Fitzpatrick suggests, that government officials may never rely on a search warrant\nissued to another government official. Rather, much like Garcia and Castro, Gardner simply\nheld that one government official cannot rely on another official’s search warrant when the two\nofficials are searching for different and unrelated evidence. True, Gardner did not mention,\n\f No. 24-1639                        Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                          Page 6\n\n\nmuch less discuss, any of our earlier decisions, but that does not mean that Gardner laid down a\nnew Fourth Amendment rule that categorically prohibits joint government searches. Indeed, the\nGardner panel could not have adopted a rule that contradicts and effectively overrules decades of\ncircuit precedent. See, e.g., United States v. Ferguson, 868 F.3d 514, 515 (6th Cir. 2017) (“One\npanel of this court may not overrule the decision of another panel; only the en banc court or the\nUnited States Supreme Court may overrule the prior panel.”).\n\n       Second, Fitzpatrick points to the Supreme Court’s decision in Wilson v. Layne, which\nheld that police officers violate the Fourth Amendment when they invite members of the media\nto join them as they execute a search warrant. 526 U.S. 603, 614 (1999). But this, too, misses\nthe mark. Wilson says nothing about whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits a joint search\nbetween two government agencies, let alone clearly establishes that such a rule exists. See\nWesby, 583 U.S. at 63 (explaining that a clearly established rule must be “dictated by controlling\nauthority,” not simply “suggested by then-existing precedent”).\n\n       As a final salvo, Fitzpatrick argues that we lack jurisdiction over her Fourth Amendment\nclaims in this interlocutory appeal because she never alleged that Simon read the search warrant\nissued to Officer Hanney, which means, in her view, that certain necessary facts are missing for\nus to decide this appeal. But, as even Fitzpatrick herself elsewhere acknowledges, that fact is not\nnecessary to decide whether Fitzpatrick has a clearly established right against joint government\nsearches. And because answering that question is all that is needed to resolve the qualified\nimmunity issue on Fitzpatrick’s Fourth Amendment claims, we have jurisdiction to decide this\npart of Simon’s interlocutory appeal. See, e.g., Quigley v. Tuong Vinh Thai, 707 F.3d 675, 679\n(6th Cir. 2013).\n\n                                                B.\n\n       Before the government can evict a person from her house, the Fourteenth Amendment’s\nDue Process Clause generally requires that the government give the person both notice and a\nhearing to contest the eviction. Flatford v. City of Monroe, 17 F.3d 162, 167 (6th Cir. 1994). An\nexception to this rule exists, however, and the government may evict a person from her home\nwithout notice when there is “a special need for very prompt action” to secure an important\n\f No. 24-1639                              Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                                    Page 7\n\n\npublic interest and where the government official is “responsible for determining, under the\nstandards of a narrowly drawn statute, that it was necessary and justified in the particular\ninstance.”     Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 91 (1972).                   But even when these “exigent\ncircumstances” exist, Flatford, 17 F.3d at 167, the government must still supply the evicted\nperson with “an adequate post-deprivation procedure” to challenge the eviction, Harris v. City of\nAkron, 20 F.3d 1396, 1401 (6th Cir. 1994). Here, the parties do not dispute that Simon never\ngave Fitzpatrick notice before evicting her from her home.\n\n                                                         1.\n\n         When it comes to Fitzpatrick’s Fourteenth Amendment claims, the issue is not whether\nFitzpatrick has a clearly established right to pre-eviction notice when exigent circumstances do\nnot exist—she does. See Flatford, 17 F.3d at 167 (“The Flatfords therefore have a clearly\nestablished right to a pre-eviction hearing only in the absence of exigent circumstances.”). The\nissue instead is whether, based on the facts alleged, the so-called exigent circumstances\nexception applies. And here, the district court held that it does not because, at least in the district\ncourt’s view, “the unsanitary living conditions [in Fitzpatrick’s homes], viewed in the light most\nfavorable to Fitzpatrick, do not necessarily describe an emergency.”\n\n         Normally, a district court’s decision that a material question of fact prevents qualified\nimmunity would deprive us of jurisdiction. After all, in these interlocutory qualified immunity\nappeals, we have jurisdiction over only the legal issues presented in the district court’s decision.\nGregory v. City of Louisville, 444 F.3d 725, 742 (6th Cir. 2006). But even though that is true, we\nstill have jurisdiction here for two reasons.1\n\n         First, this Court has never treated the exigent circumstances exception to the notice\nrequirement as a material question of fact that cannot be reviewed on interlocutory appeal.\nIndeed, in Flatford v. City of Monroe, this Court reversed a district court’s decision that denied\nqualified immunity under the exigent circumstances exception after it found that the “record\nclearly contain[ed] facts from which a reasonable building inspector could conclude that the\n\n         1\n          Although neither party argues that we lack jurisdiction over the Fourteenth Amendment claims, we still\nhave an independent obligation to ensure that jurisdiction exists. See, e.g., Mickler v. Nimishillen & Tuscarawas Ry.\nCo., 13 F.3d 184, 189 (6th Cir. 1993).\n\f No. 24-1639                            Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                                 Page 8\n\n\noccupants . . . might be imminently endangered.” 17 F.3d at 168. And although we refused to do\nthe same in Gardner v. Evans, it was not because we lacked jurisdiction to decide the exigent\ncircumstances question. Rather, it was because, unlike in Flatford, the record did not show that\nthe exigent circumstances existed. See 920 F.3d at 1057 (“Many of the violations are minor\nenough that they would plainly fail to justify a red tag: the smoke detector was not installed high\nenough, the caulk in the bathtub had deteriorated, and some of the electrical outlets were missing\ncovers.”).\n\n        Second, even if we did treat the exigent circumstances exception as a material question of\nfact, we can still exercise jurisdiction in an interlocutory appeal when a district court improperly\nassesses whether the undisputed record evidence violates the Constitution. See Plumhoff v.\nRickard, 572 U.S. 765, 772-73 (2014); Roberson v. Torres, 770 F.3d 398, 402 (6th Cir. 2014).\nAnd here, the record demonstrates that the district court’s decision on that front is clearly wrong.\n\n        For one thing, Fitzpatrick has never challenged the horrid condition of her home\ndescribed in the affidavit supporting the search warrant.2 Nor has she meaningfully questioned\nwhether those conditions created “unsanitary/unsafe living conditions.” Indeed, throughout the\nentire case thus far, Fitzpatrick has offered nothing more than a single, conclusory sentence\ndiscussing the matter. That is, Fitzpatrick wrote in her complaint that because she was not home\nwhen Simon searched her house, she “did not need to be immediately protected (or protected at\nall) from the conditions inside” the home. Beyond that lone statement, however, Fitzpatrick has\nnever argued that the condition of her home did not create an unsafe living environment and has\ninstead focused entirely on whether the city provided her with an adequate post-deprivation\nprocedure to challenge her eviction. The district court therefore appears to have manufactured\nits own question of material fact where none would have otherwise existed. Cf. Hill, 2021 WL\n3661325, at *3 (holding that the plaintiffs forfeited the issue when they “offered no\ncounterargument regarding [the] emergency-circumstances determination and focused instead on\nthe general red-tagging appeal process, i.e., the post-deprivation aspect of their due-process\nclaim”).\n\n        2\n          Fitzpatrick’s counsel confirmed at oral argument that Fitzpatrick was not challenging the affidavit’s\ndescription of her homes.\n\f No. 24-1639                        Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                          Page 9\n\n\n       But regardless, even if Fitzpatrick had raised the issue, the district court’s decision would\nstill have improperly assessed whether the complaint’s allegations plausibly proved a clearly\nestablished Fourteenth Amendment violation because the “record clearly contains facts from\nwhich a reasonable building inspector could conclude” that exigent circumstances existed.\nFlatford, 17 F.3d at 168. Indeed, the Lansing Housing Code provides that a “structure is unfit for\nhuman occupancy whenever the code official finds that such structure is unsafe, unlawful or,\nbecause of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or lacks maintenance, is insanitary,\nvermin or rat infested, [or] contains filth and contamination.”             International Property\nMaintenance Code § 108.1.3 (2015) (emphasis added). And Michigan housing law defines\n“dangerous building” to include a home that is “unsanitary or unfit for human habitation”\nbecause it is “likely to cause sickness or disease.” Mich. Comp. Laws § 125.539(h) (2021).\nBased on these regulations, any reasonable housing-code officer could conclude that a house\n“coated” in chicken feces—so much so that the stench “ma[de] it difficult to breath[e]” and the\nhome could not be walked through without stepping in the feces—created unsafe living\nconditions that required immediate eviction. Simon is therefore entitled to qualified immunity\non Fitzpatrick’s pre-deprivation notice claims under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n                                                2.\n\n       Although Fitzpatrick devotes much of her brief to arguing that the City failed to supply\nher with an adequate post-deprivation process to challenge her eviction, it is clearly established\nthat she cannot hold Simon—an inferior housing-code official—accountable for that alleged\nfailure. See Gardner, 920 F.3d at 1063-64. She remains free, however, to pursue that claim\nagainst the City on remand.\n\n                                                IV.\n\n       Because the undisputed facts do not show that Simon plausibly violated Fitzpatrick’s\nclearly established rights, Simon is entitled to qualified immunity on Fitzpatrick’s Fourth and\nFourteenth Amendment claims. We therefore REVERSE the decision of the district court and\nremand with instructions to dismiss the claims against Simon.\n\f No. 24-1639                          Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                      Page 10\n\n\n                               ______________________________\n\n                                  CONCURRENCE / DISSENT\n                               ______________________________\n\n       RITZ, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree that Officer\nMatthew Simon is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Belinda Fitzpatrick’s Fourth\nAmendment claims. I therefore concur in Section III.A of the majority’s opinion. For me,\nthough, Fitzpatrick’s Fourteenth Amendment due-process claims present a more difficult\nquestion.\n\n       Simon immediately evicted Fitzpatrick, without notice or a hearing, from her two\nproperties at 218 S. Holmes Street and 224 S. Holmes Street. On the record before us, a\nreasonable officer could have determined that exigent circumstances justified the immediate\neviction of Fitzpatrick from 218 S. Holmes. Thus, I agree with the majority that the district court\nshould have granted Simon qualified immunity with respect to Fitzpatrick’s Fourteenth\nAmendment claim as to that property. But in my view, the record is too premature to reach the\nsame conclusion as to 224 S. Holmes, Fitzpatrick’s actual residence. Considering the facts in the\nlight most favorable to Fitzpatrick, the district court was right to deny Simon’s motion to dismiss\nFitzpatrick’s due-process claim as to her home. Because the majority sees it otherwise, I\nrespectfully dissent on this point.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       As an initial matter, I agree that we have jurisdiction over this appeal. We typically\nexercise jurisdiction over qualified-immunity appeals “that rest on a mixed question of law and\nfact.” Flint ex rel. Flint v. Kentucky Dep’t of Corr., 270 F.3d 340, 347 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing\nWilliams v. Mehra, 186 F.3d 685, 690 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc)). And the question whether the\nfacts surrounding Simon’s red-tagging of Fitzpatrick’s properties, as alleged by Fitzpatrick,\nsatisfy the exigent-circumstances exception is a mixed question of law and fact. See Williams,\n186 F.3d at 690. Indeed, as the majority notes, we have consistently exercised jurisdiction over\nthis issue in qualified-immunity appeals. See Gardner v. Evans, 920 F.3d 1038, 1057-59 (6th\nCir. 2019) (reviewing at summary-judgment stage whether facts fit within exigent-circumstances\n\f No. 24-1639                         Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                         Page 11\n\n\nexception); Sell v. City of Columbus, 47 F. App’x 685, 696-99 (6th Cir. 2002) (same); Flatford v.\nCity of Monroe, 17 F.3d 162, 167-68 (6th Cir. 1994) (same).\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       Ordinarily, the government “must provide notice and a hearing prior to eviction from a\nproperty.” Hill v. Whitford, No. 20-2076, 2021 WL 3661325, at *2 (6th Cir. Aug. 18, 2021)\n(quoting Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 82 (1972)). That is because “evictions are a particularly\nsignificant deprivation, arguably more so than the temporary deprivation of certain pieces of\nproperty.” Gardner, 920 F.3d at 1061 (citing City of W. Covina v. Perkins, 525 U.S. 234, 236\n(1999)). An eviction prior to notice or a hearing means that an individual “immediately” has to\n“find[] a place to sleep” and can result in additional hardships. Id. (noting that eviction can lead\nto the loss of “access to a computer or the internet” and to the “mail [since it] is not delivered to\nred-tagged homes”). In short, an immediate eviction renders the individual homeless. See id.\nThe Constitution thus guarantees an “extremely important” right to adequate notice and a hearing\nprior to eviction, so that residents can meaningfully respond to possible condemnations of their\nhomes. See Grayden v. Rhodes, 345 F.3d 1225, 1243 (11th Cir. 2003).\n\n       True, the government may evict residents from their homes before notice or a hearing\nwhen there are “exigent circumstances.” Gardner, 920 F.3d at 1058-59 (quoting Flatford,\n17 F.3d at 167). This is a narrow exception, though. For an officer to be entitled to qualified\nimmunity after evicting someone without pre-deprivation process, the record must show the\ncircumstances surrounding the eviction posed not just any “emergency,” but one where\nimmediate eviction was “necessary and justified.” Sell, 47 F. App’x at 698 (quoting Flatford,\n17 F.3d at 170).\n\n       A need to protect individuals from “an immediate risk of serious bodily harm” meets that\nhigh bar. Flatford, 17 F.3d at 167. To illustrate, in Flatford, we reversed the denial of qualified\nimmunity for city officials who evicted occupants without notice or a hearing, where the\noccupants “faced an immediate risk of electrocution or fire” from their apartment building’s\n“structural failure and extensive ‘wood-rot’ exposed to electrical wiring and the presence of\ncombustibles.” Id. at 165-68. But absent such a showing of an immediate risk of serious harm,\n\f No. 24-1639                        Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                       Page 12\n\n\nwe have denied qualified immunity. For example, in Gardner, we held that officials were not\nimmune from suit after immediately evicting occupants from their homes, where the record\nrevealed only “minor” building-code violations such as a smoke detector that was not installed\nhigh enough, deteriorating caulk in a bathtub, and electrical outlets that were missing covers, as\nwell as other violations that were “too vague to allow one to decipher their severity, such as\naccumulation of ‘debris.’” 920 F.3d at 1057-59.\n\n                                               III.\n\n       I agree with the majority that, under these principles, Simon is entitled to qualified\nimmunity as to his immediate eviction of Fitzpatrick from 218 S. Holmes. But at this early stage\nof the case, the district court was right to deny Simon qualified immunity as to 224 S. Holmes.\n\n                                                A.\n\n       Start with 218 S. Holmes. Animal Control Officer Kyle Hanney’s affidavit detailed the\nfirsthand observations he made from inside that structure. Upon entry, he saw that the residence\nwas “extremely cluttered with personal belongings that were coated in what appeared to be\nchicken feces.” RE 24-1, Hanney Aff., PageID 441. Hanney was also overcome with “a very\nstrong odor of ammonia making it difficult to breath[e].” Id. Further, “[d]ue to the excess\nclutter, there were only narrow walkways through the residence”; those walkways “were all\ncoated with chicken feces forcing [Hanney] to walk through the feces.” Id. Hanney also went\ndown to the basement, which was “in the same . . . physical condition as the main level,” with\nthe walkways “covered with more feces, chicken feed, and other dirt/debris.” Id. Hanney\nspotted a total of a “3 free roaming chickens and 8 caged chickens” inside the house. Id.\n\n       At the motion-to-dismiss stage, the court is generally bound by the allegations in the\ncomplaint and must consider them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Heyne v. Metro.\nNashville Pub. Sch., 655 F.3d 556, 562-63 (6th Cir. 2011). When a defendant raises qualified\nimmunity as a defense, however, the plaintiff has the burden of showing that qualified immunity\ndoes not apply.    Johnson v. Moseley, 790 F.3d 649, 653 (6th Cir. 2015) (citing Reilly v.\nVadlamudi, 680 F.3d 617, 623 (6th Cir. 2012)). As the majority notes, Fitzpatrick’s complaint\ndid not specifically challenge Hanney’s observations of the conditions inside 218 S. Holmes.\n\f No. 24-1639                        Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                        Page 13\n\n\nAnd Fitzpatrick confirmed at oral argument that she does not dispute the statements made in\nHanney’s affidavit. In light of Fitzpatrick’s failure to contravene the affidavit’s descriptions of\n218 S. Holmes, I agree with the majority that a reasonable building inspector could have\nconcluded that exigent circumstances warranted an immediate eviction for Fitzpatrick’s safety.\nSee Flatford, 17 F.3d at 168 (granting qualified immunity where “[t]he record clearly contain[ed]\nfacts from which a reasonable building inspector could conclude that the occupants, and\nparticularly the children, might be imminently endangered”). Therefore, Simon is entitled to\nqualified immunity with respect to 218 S. Holmes.\n\n                                                B.\n\n       In my view, though, the record does not support the same conclusion as to 224 S.\nHolmes. For starters, Hanney’s affidavit explained that he was on the scene because of a\ncomplaint about chickens inside 218 S. Holmes.             But the tipster apparently provided no\ninformation about 224 S. Holmes, where Fitzpatrick had been living. And while Fitzpatrick\nallowed Hanney to enter 218 S. Holmes, she refused Hanney’s request to enter 224 S. Holmes.\nSo, Hanney did not see the inside of 224 S. Holmes, and the affidavit contains little to no\ninformation as to the living conditions inside the home.\n\n       Instead, Hanney’s affidavit focused on his observations from the outside of 224 S.\nHolmes. According to the affidavit, Hanney saw chickens and ducks in the backyard, being kept\nin unsanitary conditions. But these facts, while suggestive of a risk to the health of the animals\noutside the house, fail to show a risk of serious injury to Fitzpatrick warranting her immediate\neviction from inside the house. See Sell, 47 F. App’x at 696 (“The health of the outside\n[animals] c[annot] provide . . . a basis for ordering an emergency eviction.”); see also Flatford,\n17 F.3d at 167 (“Protecting citizens from an immediate risk of serious bodily harm falls squarely\nwithin those ‘extraordinary situations.’” (emphasis added)).\n\n       To be sure, the affidavit contains Fitzpatrick’s admissions that there were two chickens\ninside 224 S. Holmes, as well as animal feces “that she had not cleaned.” RE 24-1, Hanney Aff.,\nPageID 441. Fitzpatrick additionally stated that her kitchen was “messy” and that she feared\nofficials would find her properties “condemnable” if they viewed the inside. Id. Also, the\n\f No. 24-1639                              Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                                  Page 14\n\n\ncorrection notice issued by Simon after red-tagging the house states that the “interior of [the]\nhome [wa]s covered with a large amount of chicken feces” and that there were “[c]overs missing\nfrom some electrical switches and plugs.” RE 21-1, Correction Notice, PageID 404.\n\n        For several reasons, though, these facts do not entitle Simon to qualified immunity. To\nstart with, the exigent-circumstances analysis requires an objective inquiry. Gardner, 920 F.3d\nat 1058. Fitzpatrick’s subjective belief, as a civilian, that her house was “condemnable” does not\nestablish that exigent circumstances in fact existed in her house from the view of a reasonable\nbuilding inspector. Nor does her statement establish that she was under imminent risk of serious\ninjury, such that any “condemnation” of the property needed to happen immediately, without\ngiving her the chance to remedy any code violations. In fact, it is plausible that the statement\nsimply reflected Fitzpatrick’s stress upon learning that someone had complained to government\nofficials about her rather unorthodox pets. She may also have developed a fear of Lansing code-\nenforcement officials, whether because, as she alleged in her complaint, the building inspectors\nin Lansing had a “long history” of teaming up with other city officials to inspect homes for code\nviolations, RE 12, Am. Compl., ¶¶ 62-63, or because she was aware the city frequently evicted\nresidents without process, id. ¶ 156.1            Allowing this case to proceed to discovery might\nilluminate exactly what Fitzpatrick meant by her comments. But for now, we must interpret her\nstatements in the light most favorable to her. Heyne, 655 F.3d at 562-63. And to permit\nimmediate eviction based on such statements would create a perverse incentive for officers to\nred-tag properties without first ascertaining whether the conditions inside a house truly justify an\neviction.\n\n        Furthermore, while Fitzpatrick has conceded the facts in Hanney’s affidavit, Fitzpatrick\nhas not conceded the accuracy of what Simon reported about the inside of 224 S. Holmes in his\ncorrection notice. In fact, her complaint challenged his account. See RE 12, Am. Compl., ¶¶ 69,\n71-73. Besides, we have held that minor building-code violations like missing covers from\n\n\n        1\n          This is not the first time we have encountered a claim that Lansing code-enforcement officers violated the\nFourteenth Amendment rights of property owners by red-tagging their properties. See Hill, 2021 WL 3661325, at\n*1; Gardner, 920 F.3d at 1044. Gardner, notably, involved “four different Lansing homes” that were searched and\nred-tagged after a “pattern” of “aggressive” searches during which code-enforcement officers teamed up with police.\n920 F.3d at 1044.\n\f No. 24-1639                        Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                         Page 15\n\n\nelectrical switches and plugs do not justify immediate eviction. Gardner, 920 F.3d at 1057\n(denying qualified immunity where “[m]any of the violations [we]re minor,” including “some of\nthe electrical outlets . . . missing covers”). Nor does the mere “accumulation of debris.” Id.\n\n       In any event, the few details in the record about Fitzpatrick’s living conditions at 224 S.\nHolmes stand in clear contrast with Hanney’s detailed observations of the inside of 218 S.\nHolmes, which included a floor-by-floor description of animal feces being “coated” over the\nwalkways and personal belongings; 11 live chickens; and a very strong odor of ammonia making\nit difficult to breathe. And to the degree the limited evidence about 224 S. Holmes suggests that\nSimon was justified in evicting Fitzpatrick from 224 S. Holmes immediately, that suggestion is\nbelied by the allegations in Fitzpatrick’s complaint, which I would characterize more robustly\nthan the majority does. Fitzpatrick alleged that she “did not need to be immediately protected (or\nprotected at all) from the conditions inside” the home. RE 12, Am. Compl., ¶ 64. By itself, that\nis a clear enough statement to create a factual dispute as to the living conditions at 224 S.\nHolmes—the property where, even according to Hanney, Fitzpatrick had been living for a while.\nThe complaint also described how Simon had not inspected the whole residence at 224 S.\nHolmes and how his correction notice contained deficiencies and inaccuracies. See id. ¶ 71\n(“Simon also admitted that he was not able to do a complete inspection [of 224 S. Holmes]\nconflicting with his claim that [exigent] circumstances existed throughout the dwelling.”); id.\n¶ 72 (“Simon falsely claimed that insanitary conditions existed in the garage because 224 S.\nHolmes Street does not have a garage.”); id. ¶¶ 69, 73 (alleging that the correction notice lacked\nspecificity as to the “areas [that must] be cleaned and sanitized with bleach” inside 224 S.\nHolmes and as to how the “structure was unfit for human occupancy”).\n\n       If Fitzpatrick’s allegations in her complaint seem conclusory, that is not surprising,\nconsidering the case has not proceeded to discovery. But on this record, they are no more\nconclusory than Simon’s position that the inside of 224 S. Holmes was so hazardous that\nFitzpatrick could not have spent one more hour there.               See Grayden, 345 F.3d at\n1243 (recognizing exceptional hardship in being evicted with even 36 hours’ notice). After all, a\n“messy” house does not rise to the level of an emergency threat to human health and safety. See\nGardner, 920 F.3d at 1058 (“[A] living condition may be ‘unsatisfactory’ without rising to the\n\f No. 24-1639                        Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                       Page 16\n\n\nlevel of an emergency justifying the immediate deprivation of an exceedingly important property\ninterest without the benefit of a hearing.”). Many people have messy kitchens, and many pet\nowners encounter pet waste on their floors. That alone does not mean governmental authorities\nshould be able to evict them from their homes immediately.\n\n       The parties’ dispute over the conditions of Fitzpatrick’s home illustrates why “it is\ngenerally inappropriate for a district court to grant a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on the basis of\nqualified immunity.” Wesley v. Campbell, 779 F.3d 421, 433-34 (6th Cir. 2015) (collecting\ncases). Where the facts are so underdeveloped as to support divergent interpretations, the court\nshould leave the qualified-immunity determination for the summary-judgment stage. See Evans-\nMarshall v. Bd. of Educ. of Tipp City Exempted Vill. Sch. Dist., 428 F.3d 223, 235 (6th Cir.\n2005) (Sutton, J., concurring) (observing that the fact-intensive nature of the applicable tests\nmakes it “difficult for a defendant to claim qualified immunity on the pleadings before\ndiscovery”). Perhaps further development of the record—via testimony or even photos of the\ninside of the residence—would vindicate Simon’s position. But weighing the limited universe of\nfacts about 224 S. Holmes in the light most favorable to Fitzpatrick, the district court correctly\nconcluded that the facts, as they stand now, “do not necessarily describe an emergency” with\nrespect to her living conditions there. RE 26, Dist. Ct. Op., PageID 458; see also Koch v. Dep’t\nof Nat. Res., 858 F. App’x 832, 838 (6th Cir. 2021) (noting that qualified immunity is\ninappropriate at the motion-to-dismiss stage unless “the ‘complaint establishes the defense’”\n(quoting Siefert v. Hamilton County, 951 F.3d 753, 762 (6th Cir. 2020))).\n\n       There is a final reason to deny qualified immunity to Simon as to 224 S. Holmes. In\naddition to the “the clear constitutional mandate that an eviction without a hearing occur only in\nemergency circumstances . . . , precedents from this circuit [further] limit[] those emergency\ncircumstances to those situations where [immediate] eviction is ‘necessary and justified.’” Sell,\n47 F. App’x at 698 (quoting Flatford, 17 F.3d at 170). As we have observed, “[t]here is a\nsignificant difference between ‘immediate action’ and immediate eviction.”           Id. at 699.\nEmergencies call for an immediate action, but not every emergency necessitates and justifies an\nimmediate eviction as the sole remedy. See id. (reversing grant of qualified immunity and\nremanding where “the record d[id] not indicate whether the officers . . . reasonably believed an\n\f No. 24-1639                         Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                       Page 17\n\n\nemergency eviction without awaiting even an expedited hearing was necessary”); see also\nGardner, 920 F.3d at 1058. Thus, even if the officer reasonably concluded that the situation\npresented an emergency, the record must also show that officer ruled out “immediate action\noptions other than vacating the home immediately.” Sell, 47 F. App’x at 699; see also Flatford,\n17 F.3d at 168 (permitting immediate eviction where record showed occupants, including\nchildren, were “imminently endangered”).\n\n       The record is unclear in this regard as well. Simon’s argument boils down to the fact that\n224 S. Holmes was “messy” and thus “unfit for occupancy.” CA6 R. 18, Appellant Br., at 23.\nBut it is unclear why Fitzpatrick could not have been given a chance to clean up the mess before\nbeing evicted. As Fitzpatrick points out, unsanitary conditions at 224 S. Holmes could have been\naddressed through a warning or citation, which would have notified Fitzpatrick of the need to\nclean up the premises. See Sell, 47 F. App’x at 698-99 (recognizing abatement of the unsanitary\nconditions and expedited pre-deprivation hearing as alternative options to immediate eviction).\nThat the authorities had already removed the chickens by the time of the red-tagging only\nreinforces the fact that Fitzpatrick could have been given the opportunity to clean up the existing\nanimal waste. Our clearly established law guaranteed her at least that much.\n\n                                                IV.\n\n       “An emergency eviction from one’s home is a significant intrusion.” Flatford, 17 F.3d at\n168. As such, when an individual has allegedly been deprived of an “exceedingly important\nproperty interest” in this way, we must be careful not to dismiss that claim prematurely. See\nGardner, 920 F.3d at 1058. Here, the record fails to show exigent circumstances so unsafe as to\njustify Simon’s immediate eviction of Fitzpatrick from her home at 224 S. Holmes.\nAccordingly, I would affirm the district court’s denial of Simon’s motion to dismiss this claim,\nand I respectfully dissent on this point.\n\f",

BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge. In this interlocutory appeal, Matthew Simon,\na local housing-code official, argues that qualified immunity shields him from suit on Belinda\nFitzpatrick’s claims under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court denied\nSimon’s motion to dismiss after it determined that, based on the facts alleged, Simon had\nplausibly violated Fitzpatrick’s clearly established constitutional rights. For the reasons below,\nwe reverse.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       Belinda Fitzpatrick owns two adjacent homes in Lansing, Michigan, which is located in\nIngham County. Sometime in September 2021, Ingham County Animal Control received a\ncomplaint that Fitzpatrick had “up to 30 chickens being harbored” in these two adjacent homes,\nand that she had been subjecting the chickens to “unsanitary living conditions.” So, given these\nallegations, Animal Control dispatched Officer Kyle Hanney to speak with Fitzpatrick and\ninvestigate the claims against her.\n\n       After Officer Hanney and Fitzpatrick spent several minutes discussing her chickens,\nFitzpatrick agreed to let Officer Hanney look inside one of her houses. But Fitzpatrick asked\nOfficer Hanney “not to call Lansing City Code Compliance” about anything he saw because she\nwas afraid that both houses “would be condemned” if a city official saw “the inside living\nconditions.”   Officer Hanney then entered one of Fitzpatrick’s houses and immediately\nencountered a “very strong odor of ammonia” that made it “difficult [for him] to breath[e].” Not\nonly that, but Officer Hanney also observed that the house was “extremely cluttered with\npersonal belongings that were coated in what appeared to be chicken feces.” In fact, the house\ncontained so much chicken feces that Officer Hanney could not move around the house without\nwalking through the feces. Outside the home, Officer Hanney observed chickens running around\nthe backyard of Fitzpatrick’s other property in seemingly hazardous conditions.\n\f No. 24-1639                         Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                            Page 3\n\n\n       Based on what he saw, Officer Hanney successfully requested and obtained a warrant to\nsearch both of Fitzpatrick’s homes for evidence of “crimes of animal neglect and cruelty,”\nincluding “[a]ny and all living or deceased animals” and “[a]ny and all animals subjected to\nunsanitary/unsafe living conditions.”      But before returning to Fitzpatrick’s homes with the\nwarrant, Officer Hanney reached out to Matthew Simon, a local housing-code official, and\ninvited Simon to join him and his team in their search of the homes. Simon agreed to do so, and\nafter visiting Fitzpatrick’s two homes and seeing their condition, he concluded that both were\n“unfit for human occupancy” and immediately placed a “red tag” on each one. These red tags\nprohibited Fitzpatrick (or anyone else) from entering the homes until they had been thoroughly\ncleaned.\n\n       Two years later, Fitzpatrick sued Officer Hanney, Simon, and the City of Lansing,\nalleging that they had each violated her constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment, and\nthat Simon and the City had each also violated her rights under the Fourteenth Amendment.\nSimon then moved to dismiss based on qualified immunity. The district court denied Simon’s\nmotion to dismiss after it concluded that, based on the facts alleged, Simon had plausibly\nviolated Fitzpatrick’s clearly established constitutional rights.         This interlocutory appeal\nfollowed.\n\n                                                  II.\n\n       Qualified immunity shields government officials from suit unless those officials\n(1) violated a constitutional right that (2) was clearly established when the conduct occurred.\nBell v. City of Southfield, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">37 F.4th 362</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 367 (6th Cir. 2022). Proving that a constitutional right is\nclearly established is no easy task, however, and doing so requires a plaintiff to show that two\nthings are true. First, the rule establishing the right must be “settled,” meaning that it is “dictated\nby controlling authority” and not merely “suggested by then-existing precedent.” District of\nColumbia v. Wesby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">583 U.S. 48</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63 (2018). And second, the rule must “clearly prohibit the\n[official’s] conduct in the particular circumstances before him.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> It is not enough, in other\nwords, for the plaintiff to identify a case that “merely stand[s] for [a] general proposition.” Bell,\n37 F.4th at 367. Read together, these two principles require that the precedent be “clear enough\nthat every reasonable official would interpret it to establish the particular rule the plaintiff seeks\n\f No. 24-1639                       Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                       Page 4\n\n\nto apply.” Wesby, 583 U.S. at 63. In deciding qualified immunity defenses, we can address these\ntwo prongs in either order. Pearson v. Callahan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/#236\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Pearson v. Callahan\">555 U.S. 223, 236</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2009).\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       Here, Fitzpatrick maintains that Simon violated her clearly established constitutional\nrights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments when he searched her two homes for\nhousing-code violations without a warrant for those violations and then proceeded to evict her\nfrom both homes without notice. We disagree and address each issue in turn.\n\n                                                 A.\n\n       The Fourth Amendment guarantees “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their\npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches.” U.S. Const. amend. IV. At\nits core, this guarantee means that unless an exception applies, a government search will be\nunreasonable under the Fourth Amendment if the government does not have a valid search\nwarrant. See, e.g., United States v. McLevain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779802\"><a href=\"/opinion/779802/united-states-v-roger-dale-mclevain/#438\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v. Roger Dale McLevain\">310 F.3d 434, 438</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2002). While this\nprinciple most often applies to searches conducted by police officers, it also applies to\ngovernment officials who perform administrative searches for housing-code violations. Hill v.\nWhitford, No. 20-2076, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL 3661325</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (6th Cir. Aug. 18, 2021); see also City of Los\nAngeles v. Patel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">576 U.S. 409</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 419-20 (2015).\n\n       Relying on these principles, Fitzpatrick argues here that Simon violated her clearly\nestablished rights under the Fourth Amendment when he searched her home without a separate\nwarrant for housing-code violations. Although Fitzpatrick concedes, as she must, that Officer\nHanney received a valid warrant to search her home for evidence of animal neglect, she\nmaintains that this warrant did not extend to Simon—a government official from a different\nagency searching her home for different violations. We disagree.\n\n       This court has never held that the Fourth Amendment categorically prohibits joint\nsearches between two government officials when both officials rely on the same search warrant.\nTo the contrary, in United States v. Garcia, we summarized decades of precedent and concluded\nthat the Fourth Amendment allows such searches unless (1) the second official “had probable\n\f No. 24-1639                         Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                         Page 5\n\n\ncause to obtain a separate warrant,” (2) the second official “had an opportunity but failed to\nobtain a separate warrant,” and (3) the second official “was searching for items different from\nthose authorized” by the first official’s warrant. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9633391\"><a href=\"/opinion/1452969/united-states-v-garcia/#509\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v. Garcia\">496 F.3d 495, 509</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2007). These three\nconditions are in the conjunctive.\n\n       And Garcia remains the rule today. Indeed, several years ago, this court reaffirmed\nGarcia and held that federal law enforcement officers in Michigan could rely on a search warrant\nissued to state law enforcement officers in Texas “so long as they [were] searching for the same\nevidence as the state officers and the same evidence authorized by the state warrant.” United\nStates v. Castro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4243049\"><a href=\"/opinion/4465796/united-states-v-chaka-castro/#967\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v. Chaka Castro\">881 F.3d 961, 967</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2018).\n\n       To be sure, this court has not yet decided whether the Fourth Amendment allows\ngovernment officials such as Simon to search a home using a warrant obtained by a different\nofficial when both officials are looking for the same conditions, as opposed to items or evidence.\nBut given the decisions that we do have, we conclude that Simon is entitled to qualified\nimmunity on Fitzpatrick’s Fourth Amendment claims because it was not clearly established then\n(or now) that Simon was “searching for items different from those authorized” by Officer\nHanney’s warrant.     Garcia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9633391\"><a href=\"/opinion/1452969/united-states-v-garcia/#509\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v. Garcia\">496 F.3d at 509</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.         In other words, we cannot say that “every\nreasonable official” who reads Garcia and Castro would understand those decisions to mean that\nthe Fourth Amendment allows two government officials to search a home for the same items or\nevidence but does not also allow them to search a home for the same conditions. Wesby, 583\nU.S. at 63.\n\n       To argue otherwise, Fitzpatrick identifies two cases that she believes clearly established\nthe unconstitutionality of Simon’s conduct. First, Fitzpatrick relies on our decision in Gardner v.\nEvans, which held that a housing-code official could not, under the Fourth Amendment, search a\nhome for housing-code violations based on a warrant issued to police officers that allowed them\nto search that same home for drugs. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4384329\"><a href=\"/opinion/4607076/william-gardner-v-jason-evans/#1053\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: William Gardner v. Jason Evans\">920 F.3d 1038, 1053</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2019). But Gardner did not\nestablish, as Fitzpatrick suggests, that government officials may never rely on a search warrant\nissued to another government official. Rather, much like Garcia and Castro, Gardner simply\nheld that one government official cannot rely on another official’s search warrant when the two\nofficials are searching for different and unrelated evidence.

Indeed, the\nGardner panel could not have adopted a rule that contradicts and effectively overrules decades of\ncircuit precedent. See, e.g., United States v. Ferguson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4197928\"><a href=\"/opinion/4420675/united-states-v-shannon-ferguson/#515\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: United States v.

Layne, which\nheld that police officers violate the Fourth Amendment when they invite members of the media\nto join them as they execute a search warrant. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9433801\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/#614\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Wilson v.

Wilson says nothing about whether the Fourth Amendment prohibits a joint search\nbetween two government agencies, let alone clearly establishes that such a rule exists. See\nWesby, 583 U.S. at 63 (explaining that a clearly established rule must be “dictated by controlling\nauthority,” not simply “suggested by then-existing precedent”).\n\n       As a final salvo, Fitzpatrick argues that we lack jurisdiction over her Fourth Amendment\nclaims in this interlocutory appeal because she never alleged that Simon read the search warrant\nissued to Officer Hanney, which means, in her view, that certain necessary facts are missing for\nus to decide this appeal. But, as even Fitzpatrick herself elsewhere acknowledges, that fact is not\nnecessary to decide whether Fitzpatrick has a clearly established right against joint government\nsearches. And because answering that question is all that is needed to resolve the qualified\nimmunity issue on Fitzpatrick’s Fourth Amendment claims, we have jurisdiction to decide this\npart of Simon’s interlocutory appeal.

That is, Fitzpatrick wrote in her complaint that because she was not home\nwhen Simon searched her house, she “did not need to be immediately protected (or protected at\nall) from the conditions inside” the home. Beyond that lone statement, however, Fitzpatrick has\nnever argued that the condition of her home did not create an unsafe living environment and has\ninstead focused entirely on whether the city provided her with an adequate post-deprivation\nprocedure to challenge her eviction. The district court therefore appears to have manufactured\nits own question of material fact where none would have otherwise existed. Cf. Hill, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2021 WL\n3661325</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (holding that the plaintiffs forfeited the issue when they “offered no\ncounterargument regarding [the] emergency-circumstances determination and focused instead on\nthe general red-tagging appeal process, i.e., the post-deprivation aspect of their due-process\nclaim”).\n\n        2\n          Fitzpatrick’s counsel confirmed at oral argument that Fitzpatrick was not challenging the affidavit’s\ndescription of her homes.\n\f No. 24-1639                        Fitzpatrick v. Hanney, et al.                          Page 9\n\n\n       But regardless, even if Fitzpatrick had raised the issue, the district court’s decision would\nstill have improperly assessed whether the complaint’s allegations plausibly proved a clearly\nestablished Fourteenth Amendment violation because the “record clearly contains facts from\nwhich a reasonable building inspector could conclude” that exigent circumstances existed.\nFlatford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6929827\"><a href=\"/opinion/7028054/flatford-v-city-of-monroe/#168\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Flatford v.

Indeed, the Lansing Housing Code provides that a “structure is unfit for\nhuman occupancy whenever the code official finds that such structure is unsafe, unlawful or,\nbecause of the degree to which the structure is in disrepair or lacks maintenance, is insanitary,\nvermin or rat infested, [or] contains filth and contamination.”             International Property\nMaintenance Code § 108.1.3 (2015) (emphasis added).

I agree that Officer\nMatthew Simon is entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Belinda Fitzpatrick’s Fourth\nAmendment claims. I therefore concur in Section III.A of the majority’s opinion. For me,\nthough, Fitzpatrick’s Fourteenth Amendment due-process claims present a more difficult\nquestion.\n\n       Simon immediately evicted Fitzpatrick, without notice or a hearing, from her two\nproperties at 218 S. Holmes Street and 224 S. Holmes Street. On the record before us, a\nreasonable officer could have determined that exigent circumstances justified the immediate\neviction of Fitzpatrick from 218 S. Holmes. Thus, I agree with the majority that the district court\nshould have granted Simon qualified immunity with respect to Fitzpatrick’s Fourteenth\nAmendment claim as to that property. But in my view, the record is too premature to reach the\nsame conclusion as to 224 S. Holmes, Fitzpatrick’s actual residence. Considering the facts in the\nlight most favorable to Fitzpatrick, the district court was right to deny Simon’s motion to dismiss\nFitzpatrick’s due-process claim as to her home. Because the majority sees it otherwise, I\nrespectfully dissent on this point.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       As an initial matter, I agree that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.

For starters, Hanney’s affidavit explained that he was on the scene because of a\ncomplaint about chickens inside 218 S. Holmes.             But the tipster apparently provided no\ninformation about 224 S. Holmes, where Fitzpatrick had been living. And while Fitzpatrick\nallowed Hanney to enter 218 S. Holmes, she refused Hanney’s request to enter 224 S. Holmes.\nSo, Hanney did not see the inside of 224 S. Holmes, and the affidavit contains little to no\ninformation as to the living conditions inside the home.\n\n       Instead, Hanney’s affidavit focused on his observations from the outside of 224 S.\nHolmes. According to the affidavit, Hanney saw chickens and ducks in the backyard, being kept\nin unsanitary conditions. But these facts, while suggestive of a risk to the health of the animals\noutside the house, fail to show a risk of serious injury to Fitzpatrick warranting her immediate\neviction from inside the house.

To\nstart with, the exigent-circumstances analysis requires an objective inquiry. Gardner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4384329\"><a href=\"/opinion/4607076/william-gardner-v-jason-evans/#1058\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: William Gardner v.

Fitzpatrick’s subjective belief, as a civilian, that her house was “condemnable” does not\nestablish that exigent circumstances in fact existed in her house from the view of a reasonable\nbuilding inspector. Nor does her statement establish that she was under imminent risk of serious\ninjury, such that any “condemnation” of the property needed to happen immediately, without\ngiving her the chance to remedy any code violations. In fact, it is plausible that the statement\nsimply reflected Fitzpatrick’s stress upon learning that someone had complained to government\nofficials about her rather unorthodox pets. She may also have developed a fear of Lansing code-\nenforcement officials, whether because, as she alleged in her complaint, the building inspectors\nin Lansing had a “long history” of teaming up with other city officials to inspect homes for code\nviolations, RE 12, Am. Compl., ¶¶ 62-63, or because she was aware the city frequently evicted\nresidents without process, id. ¶ 156.1            Allowing this case to proceed to discovery might\nilluminate exactly what Fitzpatrick meant by her comments.

And to permit\nimmediate eviction based on such statements would create a perverse incentive for officers to\nred-tag properties without first ascertaining whether the conditions inside a house truly justify an\neviction.\n\n        Furthermore, while Fitzpatrick has conceded the facts in Hanney’s affidavit, Fitzpatrick\nhas not conceded the accuracy of what Simon reported about the inside of 224 S.

And to the degree the limited evidence about 224 S. Holmes suggests that\nSimon was justified in evicting Fitzpatrick from 224 S. Holmes immediately, that suggestion is\nbelied by the allegations in Fitzpatrick’s complaint, which I would characterize more robustly\nthan the majority does. Fitzpatrick alleged that she “did not need to be immediately protected (or\nprotected at all) from the conditions inside” the home. RE 12, Am. Compl., ¶ 64. By itself, that\nis a clear enough statement to create a factual dispute as to the living conditions at 224 S.\nHolmes—the property where, even according to Hanney, Fitzpatrick had been living for a while.\nThe complaint also described how Simon had not inspected the whole residence at 224 S.\nHolmes and how his correction notice contained deficiencies and inaccuracies. See id. ¶ 71\n(“Simon also admitted that he was not able to do a complete inspection [of 224 S. Holmes]\nconflicting with his claim that [exigent] circumstances existed throughout the dwelling.”); id.\n¶ 72 (“Simon falsely claimed that insanitary conditions existed in the garage because 224 S.\nHolmes Street does not have a garage.”); id. ¶¶ 69, 73 (alleging that the correction notice lacked\nspecificity as to the “areas [that must] be cleaned and sanitized with bleach” inside 224 S.\nHolmes and as to how the “structure was unfit for human occupancy”).\n\n       If Fitzpatrick’s allegations in her complaint seem conclusory, that is not surprising,\nconsidering the case has not proceeded to discovery. But on this record, they are no more\nconclusory than Simon’s position that the inside of 224 S. Holmes was so hazardous that\nFitzpatrick could not have spent one more hour there.               See Grayden, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9415785\"><a href=\"/opinion/76316/grayden-v-rhodes/#1243\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Grayden v.

Many people have messy kitchens, and many pet\nowners encounter pet waste on their floors. That alone does not mean governmental authorities\nshould be able to evict them from their homes immediately.\n\n       The parties’ dispute over the conditions of Fitzpatrick’s home illustrates why “it is\ngenerally inappropriate for a district court to grant a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss on the basis of\nqualified immunity.” Wesley v.

Perhaps further development of the record—via testimony or even photos of the\ninside of the residence—would vindicate Simon’s position. But weighing the limited universe of\nfacts about 224 S. Holmes in the light most favorable to Fitzpatrick, the district court correctly\nconcluded that the facts, as they stand now, “do not necessarily describe an emergency” with\nrespect to her living conditions there.

Holmes. In\naddition to the “the clear constitutional mandate that an eviction without a hearing occur only in\nemergency circumstances . . . , precedents from this circuit [further] limit[] those emergency\ncircumstances to those situations where [immediate] eviction is ‘necessary and justified.’” Sell,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7212285\"><a href=\"/opinion/7294513/sell-v-city-of-columbus/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Sell v.

As Fitzpatrick points out, unsanitary conditions at 224 S.

After being overserved at a school reunion, Bradford\n\nAnthony Gifford ended up in a holding cell at the Hamilton County Jail in Tennessee. While\n\ndetained, Gifford was attacked by one of the cell’s other occupants. As a result, Gifford received\n\nmultiple injuries and had to be taken to the emergency room for treatment. And so he sued\n\nHamilton County and its sheriff, alleging that they deprived him of his constitutional rights and\n\nviolated state law by placing him in the holding cell. Following discovery, the defendants moved\n\nfor summary judgment. The district court held that Gifford had provided no proof that would\n\nallow a reasonable jury to find in his favor and so granted summary judgment. And yet Gifford\n\nappeals, saying that material facts are in dispute. We disagree and so affirm.\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\n                                                I.\n\n       On October 2, 2021, Gifford attended a school reunion party at a classmate’s home.\n\nBecause he had been drinking, he felt that it was not safe to drive home. In essence, he claims that\n\nsince his phone was dead and there were no sidewalks, he “walked nearby to the neighbor’s house\n\nto ask for them to call a cab.” R.43-2, Gifford Decl., p.2, PageID 644. The neighbors instead\n\ncalled the police, who arrived and arrested Gifford for public intoxication and criminal trespass.\n\n       And so the arresting officers took him to the Hamilton County Jail where, as part of normal\n\nintake procedures, a “Booking Pre-Classification Checklist” was prepared. Under the jail’s intake\n\npolicy, booking officers must “initially classify all inmates as maximum security.” R.39-2,\n\nHamilton Cnty. Sheriff’s Dep’t Pol’ys, p.28, PageID 217. This policy exists “because classification\n\nis a process that requires retrieving information from a variety of sources,” which can be time-\n\nconsuming. R.43-1, Statement of Material Facts in Dispute, p.7, PageID 641. And all corrections\n\ndeputies, including those in charge of booking, receive training on these policies from the Sheriff’s\n\nOffice. Following this policy, the booking officer listed Gifford’s pre-classification recommended\n\nsecurity level as “maximum” on the checklist. So Gifford landed in Foxtrot 2, a temporary holding\n\ncell that houses pretrial detainees while officials complete the intake and booking process.\n\n       Early the next morning, officers from the Red Bank Police Department arrested Cyrion\n\nBrown and brought him to the jail. Gifford claims that Brown was arrested for assault and had “a\n\nhistory of violence.” R.43-2, Gifford Decl., p.3, PageID 645. But Brown had not been detained\n\nat the jail before, so the booking officers had no direct indication that he would not behave\n\nappropriately in the temporary holding cell. And under normal practices, detainees are “not\n\nsegregated during the intake and booking process based only on the charges alleged against them,”\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\nso “a detainee [who] behaves appropriately” during the process isn’t separated from other\n\ndetainees. R.43-1, Statement of Material Facts in Dispute, p.3, PageID 637.\n\n       And so Brown also ended up in Foxtrot 2, awaiting classification. Gifford maintains that\n\nBrown looked like he was “high on cocaine” such that “his geeked up behavior was obvious to\n\neveryone, including the jail.” R.43-2, Gifford Decl., p.3, PageID 645. Soon after he was placed\n\nin Foxtrot 2, Brown grabbed a blanket from another detainee and started to argue with him. Gifford\n\ntold Brown and the other detainee to “[k]nock it off, it’s 3 a.m.” Id. As a result, Brown attacked\n\nGifford. Brown’s assault split Gifford’s “chin wide open” and left him with “a severe concussion,\n\ntwo black eyes,” and a herniated disc in his back. Id. And Gifford was transported to the hospital\n\nfor x-rays and stitches. After the attack, Gifford told one of the Sheriff’s Office deputies that\n\nBrown’s assault “was completely unprompted.” R.43-1, Statement of Material Facts in Dispute,\n\np.6, PageID 640. And on his return to the county jail, Gifford asserts that the jail officials initially\n\ntried to put him back in Foxtrot 2—where Brown was still being held.\n\n       Gifford was released on bond the next day, and the charges against him were dropped for\n\nlack of probable cause. The county sheriff’s office also brought criminal charges against Brown\n\nfor the assault. But still the attack’s effects lingered. In short, Gifford asserts that he has\n\n“continuous, intense knee pain and a herniated disc in [his] lower back” as well as “permanent\n\nnerve damage” in his face. R.43-2, Gifford Decl., p.3, PageID 645.\n\n       And so Gifford sued Hamilton County and its sheriff, Jim Hammond, for deprivations of\n\ndue process under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and various claims under Tennessee law. After discovery,\n\nthe defendants moved separately for summary judgment, supporting their motions with several\n\nsworn declarations and evidence of training materials and official policies. In opposition to\n\nsummary judgment, Gifford provided only his own sworn declaration and an unsworn statement\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\nof material facts in dispute. After considering the evidence, the district court determined that\n\nGifford had not shown a dispute of material fact and that the defendants were entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law on the federal claims. And the court declined to exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims, dismissing them without prejudice. Gifford\n\nappealed.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Walden v. Gen. Elec.\n\nInt’l, 119 F.4th 1049, 1056 (6th Cir. 2024). Summary judgment is appropriate only when the\n\nmoving party “shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). In effect, a genuine dispute of fact\n\nis material only when “a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.” Hrdlicka\n\nv. Gen. Motors, LLC, 63 F.4th 555, 566 (6th Cir. 2023) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, 477\n\nU.S. 242, 248 (1986)). For that reason, “we construe the evidence and draw all reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of [the non-moving party]” when determining whether such a dispute exists.\n\nDoe v. Univ. of Ky., 111 F.4th 705, 715 (6th Cir. 2024). And yet the nonmoving party must do\n\nmore than introduce “some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts.” Milczak v. Gen. Motors,\n\nLLC, 102 F.4th 772, 783 (6th Cir. 2024) (quoting Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio\n\nCorp., 475 U.S. 574, 586 (1986)). Conclusory allegations—by themselves—aren’t enough.\n\nBoshaw v. Midland Brewing Co., 32 F.4th 598, 603 (6th Cir. 2022).\n\n       In his amended complaint, Gifford included three types of claims against the defendants.\n\nFirst, he asserted that Sheriff Hammond violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983 by depriving him of his due\n\nprocess right to be protected from violence committed by other detainees. Second, he claimed that\n\nHamilton County’s policies deprived him of his constitutional rights under Monell v. Department\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\nof Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978). And third, he brought several claims against both\n\ndefendants under state law. But on appeal, Gifford argues only that his Monell claim presents a\n\ngenuine dispute of material fact. 1 And so we ask whether summary judgment was appropriate for\n\nthat claim.\n\n        In creating the modern framework for § 1983 claims, the Supreme Court first interpreted\n\nthe statute’s reference to “person” as excluding municipalities from suit. See Monroe v. Pape, 365\n\nU.S. 167, 190 (1961). But less than two decades later, the Court revisited the issue in Monell,\n\n“overruling . . . Monroe insofar as it holds that local governments are not ‘persons’ who may be\n\ndefendants in § 1983 suits.” 436 U.S. at 700–01. And yet the Court clarified that a local or\n\nmunicipal government cannot be sued under a theory of respondeat superior “for an injury\n\ninflicted solely by its employees or agents.” Id. at 694. For that reason, the local government’s\n\nown “policy or custom” must cause the deprivation of the plaintiff’s constitutional or legal rights.\n\nId.\n\n        That holding gave rise to a new species of constitutional tort: the Monell claim. Within\n\nthese claims are “four recognized theories” of municipal liability: (1) an illegal or unconstitutional\n\nofficial policy, (2) ratification of illegal or unconstitutional actions by a policymaker, (3) illegal or\n\nunconstitutional actions stemming from a failure to train or supervise, and (4) “a custom of\n\ntolerance or acquiescence of federal rights violations.” Helphenstine v. Lewis County, 60 F.4th\n\n305, 323 (6th Cir. 2023) (quoting Burgess v. Fischer, 735 F.3d 462, 478 (6th Cir. 2013)).\n\n\n\n1\n  In his first and only brief before this court, Gifford doesn’t mention a § 1983 claim against Sheriff\nHammond in his personal capacity. And “[w]e normally decline to consider issues not raised in\nthe appellant’s opening brief.” Berry v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., 115 F.4th 528, 540 (6th Cir.\n2024) (quoting Priddy v. Edelman, 883 F.2d 438, 446 (6th Cir. 1989)). As a result, Gifford has\nforfeited any argument that the district court shouldn’t have granted summary judgment for\nHammond. See Island Creek Coal Co. v. Wilkerson, 910 F.3d 254, 256 (6th Cir. 2018).\n                                                   5\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\nGifford—at least arguably—raises all four theories in his briefing. And so we address each in turn\n\nto see if any present a genuine dispute of material fact.\n\n       Begin with an illegal or unconstitutional official policy. To succeed on this theory of\n\nliability, a plaintiff must “identify the municipal policy or custom” and show that his injury is\n\ntraceable to that policy. Vereecke v. Huron Valley Sch. Dist., 609 F.3d 392, 403 (6th Cir. 2010).\n\nGifford points to the county’s official policy of placing all detainees into a single temporary-\n\nholding cell during the intake and booking process. In essence, he claims that this official policy\n\ndeprives pretrial detainees like him of their constitutional rights by failing to segregate them by\n\nrisk during these initial processes. And yet Gifford does not contest that the policy required\n\nsegregation when a detainee fails to behave appropriately during intake. And though he claims in\n\nhis affidavit that Brown “appear[ed] to be high on cocaine” such that “his geeked up behavior was\n\nobvious to everyone,” Gifford fails to provide evidence of how that behavior alone revealed that\n\nBrown posed a risk to others in the temporary holding cell. R.43-2, Gifford Decl., p.3, PageID\n\n645.\n\n       In effect, Gifford argues that the county’s official policy caused a constitutional deprivation\n\nbecause it placed non-violent offense detainees like him in the same cell as those accused of violent\n\ncrimes. But, as we have recognized, during initial intake and booking “the offense of arrest is not\n\na reliable indicator of dangerousness; and even if it was there is often insufficient information\n\nabout each new detainee’s criminal history in order to make that assessment.” Sumpter v. Wayne\n\nCounty, 868 F.3d 473, 481 (6th Cir. 2017) (citing Florence v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of Cnty.\n\nof Burlington, 566 U.S. 318, 334–37 (2012)). And the mere fact that a policy does not prevent\n\nevery random act of violence doesn’t make it constitutionally insufficient. See, e.g., Hester v.\n\nMorgan, 52 F. App’x 220, 225 (6th Cir. 2002) (“Despite precautions, it is impossible to stop all\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\nrandom acts of violence in the prison environment.”). And so Gifford cannot demonstrate that his\n\ninjury stemmed from this official policy or custom, leaving no dispute of material fact on this\n\npoint.\n\n         Second, we analyze whether municipal liability exists because of a policymaker’s\n\nratification of illegal or unconstitutional actions. Under this theory, municipal liability attaches\n\nwhen a “decisionmaker [who] possesses final authority to establish municipal policy with respect\n\nto the action” approves the unconstitutional conduct. Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469,\n\n481 (1986). But a plaintiff can also demonstrate municipal ratification by showing a failure to\n\ninvestigate when there were “multiple earlier inadequate investigations [that] concern comparable\n\nclaims.” Moiser v. Evans, 90 F.4th 541, 549 (6th Cir. 2024) (alteration in original) (quoting Pineda\n\nv. Hamilton County, 977 F.3d 483, 495 (6th Cir. 2020)). And yet Gifford can do neither. Indeed,\n\nhe has not identified the policymaking official who could have ratified the allegedly\n\nunconstitutional conduct. Nor has he shown a pattern of failing to investigate comparable claims. 2\n\nAnd so even under a ratification theory, Gifford cannot show a dispute of material fact that\n\nprevents summary judgment.\n\n         Third, we consider Gifford’s claim that the county failed to train and supervise its\n\nemployees on risk prevention and monitoring detainees. To establish a failure-to-train or a failure-\n\n\n2\n  We note that this circuit has not clarified how many instances of comparable conduct a plaintiff\nmust show or how similar they must be to his own injury. See Franklin v. Franklin County, 115\nF.4th 461, 472 (6th Cir. 2024). But that doesn’t matter here because Gifford has not provided\nevidence of any instances of comparable conduct and corresponding failures to investigate by\nHamilton County. As the district court noted, the only proof that Gifford offered to oppose\nsummary judgment was his three-page declaration, which does not discuss comparable conduct or\na failure to investigate. Gifford v. Hamilton County, No. 1:22-cv-245, 2024 WL 4195292, at *2 n.1\n(E.D. Tenn. Sept. 13, 2024). To overcome this deficit, Gifford points to the County’s admissions\nin its pleadings regarding past assaults and rapes at the jail. But he fails to explain how these\nincidents compare to his incident or how the jail officials failed to investigate them. And so he\nhas not shown a pattern of insufficient investigation leading up to his assault.\n                                                 7\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\nto-supervise claim, a plaintiff must show both that (1) the municipality acted with “deliberate\n\nindifference” to the risk of constitutional violation and (2) the improper training or supervision\n\n“actually caused” the plaintiff’s injury. Gambrel v. Knox County, 25 F.4th 391, 408–09 (6th Cir.\n\n2022) (first quoting Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397, 407 (1997); and\n\nthen quoting Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51, 70 (2011)). And to show deliberate indifference,\n\nthe plaintiff must point to either a “pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained\n\nemployees” or else “a single violation of federal rights, accompanied by a showing that [the\n\nmunicipality] has failed to train its employees to handle recurring situations presenting an obvious\n\npotential for a constitutional violation.” Shadrick v. Hopkins County, 805 F.3d 724, 738–39 (6th\n\nCir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Ouza v. City of Dearborn Heights, 969 F.3d\n\n265, 286–87 (6th Cir. 2020).\n\n        Gifford cannot make the initial showing of deliberate indifference by the county as to a\n\nconstitutional violation. After all, the evidence Gifford provided in opposition to summary\n\njudgment doesn’t demonstrate an ongoing pattern of similar constitutional violations caused by a\n\nfailure to train or supervise county employees. In a similar vein, he can’t show that the risk in this\n\ncase was so obvious and likely to recur that the county’s failure to train or supervise can be\n\nestablished by a single incident. Such single-incident claims of municipal liability, as we have\n\nclarified, remain “rare” precisely because the plaintiff bears such a high burden in showing that\n\nthe need for specific training and supervision was “obvious.” Gambrel, 25 F.4th at 410 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). For that reason, Gifford has not met his burden. While he argues that\n\nthere is a genuine issue of material fact as to the adequacy of the county’s training and supervision,\n\nhis failure to introduce sufficient evidence hamstrings this argument. And so he cannot succeed\n\nunder a failure-to-train or failure-to-supervise theory of liability.\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\n       Fourth and finally, we address Gifford’s claim that the county had a custom of tolerating\n\nconstitutional violations. To make such a claim, a plaintiff must show “(1) a clear and persistent\n\npattern of illegal activity, (2) which the [county] knew or should have known about, (3) yet\n\nremained deliberately indifferent about, and (4) that the [county’s] custom was the cause of the\n\n[constitutional deprivation].” Thomas v. City of Chattanooga, 398 F.3d 426, 433 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\nGifford’s claim fails on the first prong. Once again, the failure to introduce sufficient evidence to\n\noppose summary judgment means that Gifford cannot show a pattern of relevant illegal activity—\n\nmuch less a clear and persistent one. See Winkler v. Madison County, 893 F.3d 877, 902 (6th Cir.\n\n2018). And so Gifford can’t show a genuine dispute of material fact that must proceed to a jury,\n\nmeaning that his invocation of this last theory of municipal liability fares no better than the\n\nprevious three.\n\n                                              III.\n\n       Gifford cannot point to a genuine dispute of material fact that would make summary\n\njudgment inappropriate. Since the county is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the asserted\n\nMonell claim, we AFFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f",

After being overserved at a school reunion, Bradford\n\nAnthony Gifford ended up in a holding cell at the Hamilton County Jail in Tennessee. While\n\ndetained, Gifford was attacked by one of the cell’s other occupants. As a result, Gifford received\n\nmultiple injuries and had to be taken to the emergency room for treatment. And so he sued\n\nHamilton County and its sheriff, alleging that they deprived him of his constitutional rights and\n\nviolated state law by placing him in the holding cell. Following discovery, the defendants moved\n\nfor summary judgment. The district court held that Gifford had provided no proof that would\n\nallow a reasonable jury to find in his favor and so granted summary judgment. And yet Gifford\n\nappeals, saying that material facts are in dispute. We disagree and so affirm.\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\n                                                I.\n\n       On October 2, 2021, Gifford attended a school reunion party at a classmate’s home.\n\nBecause he had been drinking, he felt that it was not safe to drive home. In essence, he claims that\n\nsince his phone was dead and there were no sidewalks, he “walked nearby to the neighbor’s house\n\nto ask for them to call a cab.” R.43-2, Gifford Decl., p.2, PageID 644. The neighbors instead\n\ncalled the police, who arrived and arrested Gifford for public intoxication and criminal trespass.\n\n       And so the arresting officers took him to the Hamilton County Jail where, as part of normal\n\nintake procedures, a “Booking Pre-Classification Checklist” was prepared. Under the jail’s intake\n\npolicy, booking officers must “initially classify all inmates as maximum security.” R.39-2,\n\nHamilton Cnty. Sheriff’s Dep’t Pol’ys, p.28, PageID 217. This policy exists “because classification\n\nis a process that requires retrieving information from a variety of sources,” which can be time-\n\nconsuming. R.43-1, Statement of Material Facts in Dispute, p.7, PageID 641. And all corrections\n\ndeputies, including those in charge of booking, receive training on these policies from the Sheriff’s\n\nOffice. Following this policy, the booking officer listed Gifford’s pre-classification recommended\n\nsecurity level as “maximum” on the checklist. So Gifford landed in Foxtrot 2, a temporary holding\n\ncell that houses pretrial detainees while officials complete the intake and booking process.\n\n       Early the next morning, officers from the Red Bank Police Department arrested Cyrion\n\nBrown and brought him to the jail. Gifford claims that Brown was arrested for assault and had “a\n\nhistory of violence.” R.43-2, Gifford Decl., p.3, PageID 645. But Brown had not been detained\n\nat the jail before, so the booking officers had no direct indication that he would not behave\n\nappropriately in the temporary holding cell. And under normal practices, detainees are “not\n\nsegregated during the intake and booking process based only on the charges alleged against them,”\n\n\n\n\n                                                 2\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\nso “a detainee [who] behaves appropriately” during the process isn’t separated from other\n\ndetainees. R.43-1, Statement of Material Facts in Dispute, p.3, PageID 637.\n\n       And so Brown also ended up in Foxtrot 2, awaiting classification. Gifford maintains that\n\nBrown looked like he was “high on cocaine” such that “his geeked up behavior was obvious to\n\neveryone, including the jail.” R.43-2, Gifford Decl., p.3, PageID 645. Soon after he was placed\n\nin Foxtrot 2, Brown grabbed a blanket from another detainee and started to argue with him. Gifford\n\ntold Brown and the other detainee to “[k]nock it off, it’s 3 a.m.” Id. As a result, Brown attacked\n\nGifford. Brown’s assault split Gifford’s “chin wide open” and left him with “a severe concussion,\n\ntwo black eyes,” and a herniated disc in his back. Id. And Gifford was transported to the hospital\n\nfor x-rays and stitches. After the attack, Gifford told one of the Sheriff’s Office deputies that\n\nBrown’s assault “was completely unprompted.” R.43-1, Statement of Material Facts in Dispute,\n\np.6, PageID 640. And on his return to the county jail, Gifford asserts that the jail officials initially\n\ntried to put him back in Foxtrot 2—where Brown was still being held.\n\n       Gifford was released on bond the next day, and the charges against him were dropped for\n\nlack of probable cause. The county sheriff’s office also brought criminal charges against Brown\n\nfor the assault. But still the attack’s effects lingered. In short, Gifford asserts that he has\n\n“continuous, intense knee pain and a herniated disc in [his] lower back” as well as “permanent\n\nnerve damage” in his face. R.43-2, Gifford Decl., p.3, PageID 645.\n\n       And so Gifford sued Hamilton County and its sheriff, Jim Hammond, for deprivations of\n\ndue process under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">42 U.S.C. § 1983</span><pre class=\"inline\"> and various claims under Tennessee law. After discovery,\n\nthe defendants moved separately for summary judgment, supporting their motions with several\n\nsworn declarations and evidence of training materials and official policies. In opposition to\n\nsummary judgment, Gifford provided only his own sworn declaration and an unsworn statement\n\n\n                                                   3\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\nof material facts in dispute. After considering the evidence, the district court determined that\n\nGifford had not shown a dispute of material fact and that the defendants were entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law on the federal claims. And the court declined to exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims, dismissing them without prejudice. Gifford\n\nappealed.\n\n                                               II.\n\n       We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo. Walden v. Gen.

Second, he claimed that\n\nHamilton County’s policies deprived him of his constitutional rights under Monell v. Department\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\nof Social Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9427232\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.\">436 U.S. 658</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978). And third, he brought several claims against both\n\ndefendants under state law. But on appeal, Gifford argues only that his Monell claim presents a\n\ngenuine dispute of material fact. 1 And so we ask whether summary judgment was appropriate for\n\nthat claim.\n\n        In creating the modern framework for § 1983 claims, the Supreme Court first interpreted\n\nthe statute’s reference to “person” as excluding municipalities from suit. See Monroe v. Pape, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9422118\"><a href=\"/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/#190\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Monroe v. Pape\">365\n\nU.S. 167, 190</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1961). But less than two decades later, the Court revisited the issue in Monell,\n\n“overruling . . . Monroe insofar as it holds that local governments are not ‘persons’ who may be\n\ndefendants in § 1983 suits.” 436 U.S. at 700–01. And yet the Court clarified that a local or\n\nmunicipal government cannot be sued under a theory of respondeat superior “for an injury\n\ninflicted solely by its employees or agents.” Id. at 694. For that reason, the local government’s\n\nown “policy or custom” must cause the deprivation of the plaintiff’s constitutional or legal rights.\n\nId.\n\n        That holding gave rise to a new species of constitutional tort: the Monell claim. Within\n\nthese claims are “four recognized theories” of municipal liability: (1) an illegal or unconstitutional\n\nofficial policy, (2) ratification of illegal or unconstitutional actions by a policymaker, (3) illegal or\n\nunconstitutional actions stemming from a failure to train or supervise, and (4) “a custom of\n\ntolerance or acquiescence of federal rights violations.” Helphenstine v. Lewis County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">60 F.4th\n\n305</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 323 (6th Cir. 2023) (quoting Burgess v.

Gene Fischer\">735 F.3d 462, 478</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2013)).\n\n\n\n1\n  In his first and only brief before this court, Gifford doesn’t mention a § 1983 claim against Sheriff\nHammond in his personal capacity. And “[w]e normally decline to consider issues not raised in\nthe appellant’s opening brief.” Berry v. Experian Info. Sols., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">115 F.4th 528</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540 (6th Cir.\n2024) (quoting Priddy v.

Asher B. Edelman,...\">883 F.2d 438, 446</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1989)). As a result, Gifford has\nforfeited any argument that the district court shouldn’t have granted summary judgment for\nHammond. See Island Creek Coal Co. v. Wilkerson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4346621\"><a href=\"/opinion/4569368/island-creek-coal-co-v-jay-wilkerson/#256\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Island Creek Coal Co. v.

Hamilton County\n\n\nGifford—at least arguably—raises all four theories in his briefing. And so we address each in turn\n\nto see if any present a genuine dispute of material fact.\n\n       Begin with an illegal or unconstitutional official policy. To succeed on this theory of\n\nliability, a plaintiff must “identify the municipal policy or custom” and show that his injury is\n\ntraceable to that policy. Vereecke v. Huron Valley Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148904\"><a href=\"/opinion/148904/vereecke-v-huron-valley-school-district/#403\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Vereecke v. Huron Valley School District\">609 F.3d 392, 403</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2010).\n\nGifford points to the county’s official policy of placing all detainees into a single temporary-\n\nholding cell during the intake and booking process. In essence, he claims that this official policy\n\ndeprives pretrial detainees like him of their constitutional rights by failing to segregate them by\n\nrisk during these initial processes. And yet Gifford does not contest that the policy required\n\nsegregation when a detainee fails to behave appropriately during intake. And though he claims in\n\nhis affidavit that Brown “appear[ed] to be high on cocaine” such that “his geeked up behavior was\n\nobvious to everyone,” Gifford fails to provide evidence of how that behavior alone revealed that\n\nBrown posed a risk to others in the temporary holding cell. R.43-2, Gifford Decl., p.3, PageID\n\n645.\n\n       In effect, Gifford argues that the county’s official policy caused a constitutional deprivation\n\nbecause it placed non-violent offense detainees like him in the same cell as those accused of violent\n\ncrimes. But, as we have recognized, during initial intake and booking “the offense of arrest is not\n\na reliable indicator of dangerousness; and even if it was there is often insufficient information\n\nabout each new detainee’s criminal history in order to make that assessment.” Sumpter v. Wayne\n\nCounty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9877945\"><a href=\"/opinion/4419982/amanda-sumpter-v-wayne-cty/#481\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Amanda Sumpter v.

Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of...\">566 U.S. 318</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 334–37 (2012)). And the mere fact that a policy does not prevent\n\nevery random act of violence doesn’t make it constitutionally insufficient. See, e.g., Hester v.\n\nMorgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"7213757\"><a href=\"/opinion/7295964/hester-v-morgan/#225\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Hester v. Morgan\">52 F. App’x 220, 225</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2002) (“Despite precautions, it is impossible to stop all\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\nrandom acts of violence in the prison environment.”). And so Gifford cannot demonstrate that his\n\ninjury stemmed from this official policy or custom, leaving no dispute of material fact on this\n\npoint.\n\n         Second, we analyze whether municipal liability exists because of a policymaker’s\n\nratification of illegal or unconstitutional actions. Under this theory, municipal liability attaches\n\nwhen a “decisionmaker [who] possesses final authority to establish municipal policy with respect\n\nto the action” approves the unconstitutional conduct. Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9430387\"><a href=\"/opinion/111615/pembaur-v-city-of-cincinnati/#481\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati\">475 U.S. 469,\n\n481</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986). But a plaintiff can also demonstrate municipal ratification by showing a failure to\n\ninvestigate when there were “multiple earlier inadequate investigations [that] concern comparable\n\nclaims.” Moiser v. Evans, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">90 F.4th 541</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549 (6th Cir. 2024) (alteration in original) (quoting Pineda\n\nv. Hamilton County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">977 F.3d 483</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 495 (6th Cir. 2020)). And yet Gifford can do neither. Indeed,\n\nhe has not identified the policymaking official who could have ratified the allegedly\n\nunconstitutional conduct. Nor has he shown a pattern of failing to investigate comparable claims. 2\n\nAnd so even under a ratification theory, Gifford cannot show a dispute of material fact that\n\nprevents summary judgment.\n\n         Third, we consider Gifford’s claim that the county failed to train and supervise its\n\nemployees on risk prevention and monitoring detainees. To establish a failure-to-train or a failure-\n\n\n2\n  We note that this circuit has not clarified how many instances of comparable conduct a plaintiff\nmust show or how similar they must be to his own injury. See Franklin v. Franklin County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">115\nF.4th 461</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 (6th Cir. 2024). But that doesn’t matter here because Gifford has not provided\nevidence of any instances of comparable conduct and corresponding failures to investigate by\nHamilton County. As the district court noted, the only proof that Gifford offered to oppose\nsummary judgment was his three-page declaration, which does not discuss comparable conduct or\na failure to investigate. Gifford v. Hamilton County, No. 1:22-cv-245, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">2024 WL 4195292</span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 n.1\n(E.D. Tenn. Sept. 13, 2024). To overcome this deficit, Gifford points to the County’s admissions\nin its pleadings regarding past assaults and rapes at the jail. But he fails to explain how these\nincidents compare to his incident or how the jail officials failed to investigate them. And so he\nhas not shown a pattern of insufficient investigation leading up to his assault.\n                                                 7\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\nto-supervise claim, a plaintiff must show both that (1) the municipality acted with “deliberate\n\nindifference” to the risk of constitutional violation and (2) the improper training or supervision\n\n“actually caused” the plaintiff’s injury. Gambrel v. Knox County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">25 F.4th 391</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 408–09 (6th Cir.\n\n2022) (first quoting Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs of Bryan Cnty. v.

And to show deliberate indifference,\n\nthe plaintiff must point to either a “pattern of similar constitutional violations by untrained\n\nemployees” or else “a single violation of federal rights, accompanied by a showing that [the\n\nmunicipality] has failed to train its employees to handle recurring situations presenting an obvious\n\npotential for a constitutional violation.” Shadrick v. Hopkins County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9820056\"><a href=\"/opinion/3152671/cindy-shadrick-v-hopkins-cnty-kentucky/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Cindy Shadrick v.

After all, the evidence Gifford provided in opposition to summary\n\njudgment doesn’t demonstrate an ongoing pattern of similar constitutional violations caused by a\n\nfailure to train or supervise county employees. In a similar vein, he can’t show that the risk in this\n\ncase was so obvious and likely to recur that the county’s failure to train or supervise can be\n\nestablished by a single incident. Such single-incident claims of municipal liability, as we have\n\nclarified, remain “rare” precisely because the plaintiff bears such a high burden in showing that\n\nthe need for specific training and supervision was “obvious.” Gambrel, 25 F.4th at 410 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). For that reason, Gifford has not met his burden. While he argues that\n\nthere is a genuine issue of material fact as to the adequacy of the county’s training and supervision,\n\nhis failure to introduce sufficient evidence hamstrings this argument. And so he cannot succeed\n\nunder a failure-to-train or failure-to-supervise theory of liability.\n\n\n                                                   8\n\fNo. 24-5893, Gifford v. Hamilton County\n\n\n       Fourth and finally, we address Gifford’s claim that the county had a custom of tolerating\n\nconstitutional violations. To make such a claim, a plaintiff must show “(1) a clear and persistent\n\npattern of illegal activity, (2) which the [county] knew or should have known about, (3) yet\n\nremained deliberately indifferent about, and (4) that the [county’s] custom was the cause of the\n\n[constitutional deprivation].” Thomas v. City of Chattanooga, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789269\"><a href=\"/opinion/789269/john-eric-thomas-and-wife-heather-thomas-v-city-of-chattanooga/#433\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: John Eric Thomas, and Wife, Heather Thomas v. City of...\">398 F.3d 426, 433</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2005).\n\nGifford’s claim fails on the first prong. Once again, the failure to introduce sufficient evidence to\n\noppose summary judgment means that Gifford cannot show a pattern of relevant illegal activity—\n\nmuch less a clear and persistent one. See Winkler v. Madison County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"4288555\"><a href=\"/opinion/4511302/charolette-winkler-v-madison-cty-ky/#902\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Charolette Winkler v. Madison Cty., Ky.\">893 F.3d 877, 902</a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir.\n\n2018). And so Gifford can’t show a genuine dispute of material fact that must proceed to a jury,\n\nmeaning that his invocation of this last theory of municipal liability fares no better than the\n\nprevious three.\n\n                                              III.\n\n       Gifford cannot point to a genuine dispute of material fact that would make summary\n\njudgment inappropriate. Since the county is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the asserted\n\nMonell claim, we AFFIRM.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f</pre>",

In April 2019, 57-year-old Nancy Hooks stopped her car in Warren,\n\nMichigan to assist a teenage victim of a street fight. She stayed on the scene to help police officers\n\nlocate the mob who had beaten him. Police officers dismissed her help, calling her a “white trash\n\nbitch.” Hooks then pulled out her cell phone and walked away, apparently to film the officers.\n\nThe police chased after her, telling her to leave. But as Hooks was walking away, an officer\n\napproached her, causing her to throw up her arm. The officer slammed Hooks to the ground,\n\nhandcuffed her, and took her away.\n\n       Hooks was prosecuted in Michigan state court for “hindering,” and a jury acquitted her.\n\nShe then sued the officers, the City of Warren, and the Warren Police Department in federal court,\n\nalleging claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Michigan law. The defendants moved for summary\n\njudgment on various grounds, and the district court granted in part and denied in part their motion.\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\nThe officers now appeal the portions of the order denying them summary judgment. For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand for further\n\nproceedings in the district court.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       Where the district court has “correctly applied the standard for summary judgment” in a\n\n§ 1983 case, we may “adopt the district court’s recitation of the facts, including casting them in\n\nthe light most favorable to” the plaintiff. Gillispie v. Miami Township, 18 F.4th 909, 912 (6th Cir.\n\n2021) (citations omitted). We do so here.\n\n       In the early evening of April 8, 2019, Nancy Hooks, then 57 years old, was driving south\n\non Lorraine Avenue in Warren, Michigan, to visit a friend. While en route, Hooks saw police cars\n\nleaving the intersection of Lorraine and Ford Street. Hooks stopped her car to speak with another\n\nfriend who was standing near the intersection, and this friend told her that the police had arrested\n\nsomeone for shooting a gun. Not long after Hooks stopped, a group of fifteen to twenty teenagers\n\nran through the intersection and started beating a teenage boy.\n\n       Hooks reported the altercation to 911 and got out of her truck to tell the boy that help was\n\non the way. Meanwhile, the group of teenagers ran away. Approximately five minutes after Hooks\n\ncalled 911, police and other first responders arrived.      Responding police officers included\n\ndefendant-appellant Officers Marchelloe Brown, Anthony Giannola, Lucas Doe, and Bryan\n\nMunafo.\n\n       What happened after police officers converged on the scene at Lorraine and Ford is the\n\nsubject of dispute. Some of what occurred is captured in two videos: dashcam footage from\n\nBrown’s police car and cellphone footage taken by a bystander. Neither of these videos completely\n\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\ncorroborates either party’s account, but they are useful in determining what happened and where\n\nthe parties’ stories diverge.\n\nI.      The dashcam video\n\n        Brown’s dashcam video footage shows approximately ten to fifteen people, including\n\nofficers, when he arrived at the intersection of Ford and Lorraine. Brown claims that, when he\n\narrived, there were “well in excess of 100 people” on the scene “arguing with officers.” RE 36-3,\n\nTrial Tr. – Vol. 1, at PageID 454. He also claims that “fights were breaking out” and that he had\n\nto “assist other officers.” RE 36-10, Brown Dep., at PageID 682. For her part, Hooks claims there\n\nwere no other fights or shouting happening when officers arrived and only between thirty to forty\n\npeople present. Because of its limited vantage point, the dashcam footage does not confirm or\n\nrefute either account.\n\n        The dashcam video then shows Brown and Giannola walking toward the group of people\n\nclustered at the intersection. Hooks, who is wearing a pink shirt and a dark jacket, approaches\n\nthem. Hooks tells the officers that she was a witness to the fight. The officers instruct her to move\n\nto the side so that they can make sure nobody has a weapon, and Hooks responds: “You’re not\n\neven looking for the kids. . . . They’re already on that block right there.” Ex. 11 to Defs.’ Mot. for\n\nSumm. J., at 05:00-18. An officer asks Hooks what the suspects looked like, and when Hooks\n\nresponds, the officer says, “That doesn’t really narrow it down.” Id. at 05:22-27. Hooks then tells\n\nthe officers again that she was a witness to the fight and the location where the group of teenagers\n\nran.\n\n        As this exchange occurs, another woman comes up to the group to tell officers that they\n\nnearly hit her and her daughter with one of their cars. Giannola tells her to “get the fuck off the\n\nstreet then,” at which point the woman starts yelling. Id. at 05:48-6:00. One can hear an officer\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\nsay, “Get in your house. You’re not going to be told again. You can shut the fuck up.” Id. at\n\n06:00-22. The dashcam video then shows people leaving the intersection, but Hooks stays behind\n\nto try to continue to speak with officers. At one point, she goes over to speak with a motorcyclist\n\nin the intersection, and then returns to the huddled officers.\n\n       Finally, Hooks is able to approach Giannola one-on-one in the intersection. The two appear\n\nto speak. Hooks then backs up from Giannola and walks past him as if to walk away. Next, she\n\nturns as if she has heard him say something to her and says, “Bitch? White trash?” Id. at 07:20-\n\n49. In her deposition, Hooks testified that Giannola called her a “white trash bitch.” RE 36-12,\n\nHooks Dep., at PageID 752. On the video, Hooks is told to “go home” and “walk away,” but\n\nHooks says that she is “57 years old, [and] you’re not gonna call me white trash.” Ex. 11 to Defs.’\n\nMot. for Summ. J., at 07:49-57.\n\n       Hooks then walks away from the officers toward a small group of approximately five\n\npeople who are standing on the corner. She takes out her phone and tells the officers that she is\n\ngoing to call their sergeant. Officers tell her to “go home” and to “[k]nock yourself out.” Id. at\n\n08:06-30.\n\n       Hooks next walks away from the group of officers and toward her truck. She pauses once\n\nshe has nearly crossed the street, turns around, and takes out her phone. Officers notice her filming\n\nthem and turn to chase her away, telling her to “Go!” Id. at 08:41. Hooks complies and walks\n\naway toward her truck. Two officers, however—Doe and Munafo—are already walking toward\n\nher. Brown says to them, “[I]f she doesn’t leave—she can go!” Id. at 08:43-44.\n\n       The view of Hooks in the dashcam footage is not clear at this point because the car is\n\nparked some distance away. But seconds later, officers tackle her to the ground and there is a\n\nnoisy commotion from the crowd, shouting “Whoa, whoa!” Id. at 8:47-49. Hooks lies on the\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\nground with several police officers on top of or immediately surrounding her. Police officers pick\n\nher up and march her away from the camera.\n\nII.    The bystander video\n\n       Cellphone footage taken from a different angle by a bystander provides a somewhat clearer\n\nview of Hooks in this latter minute. This video also shows approximately seven to ten people on\n\nthe street corners (aside from police officers) after the crowd has thinned out. On the video, Hooks\n\nwalks backwards away from officers, speaks to people standing in a yard, and then takes out her\n\nphone. The camera pans away, but when it returns to Hooks, she is standing in the street across\n\nfrom the police officers and we can see an officer approach and say something to her. Hooks\n\nwalks away from the officer; she then stops, turns around, and pulls out her cellphone to film. The\n\nbystander moves closer to Hooks. Officers chase Hooks and yell, “Go!”, at which point Hooks\n\nturns around with her phone lowered and walks away. Ex. 12 to Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J., at 0:48-\n\n50. The camera then pans away again. Officers can be seen walking and saying, “She can go!”\n\nId. at 0:50-52.\n\n       When the camera re-focuses on Hooks, the video shows that, as Doe and Munafo meet\n\nHooks, Doe tries to grab her. One cannot tell from the video whether he says anything to her.\n\nHooks pulls away and raises her left hand—in what she characterizes as a startle or reflex and what\n\nDoe took to be a fighting stance. Doe then grabs Hooks around her collarbone, pulls her down\n\nbackwards onto the ground, and gets on top of her. Bystanders are immediately heard saying,\n\n“Hey, hey! That is not right.” Id. at 0:57. Two other officers assist Doe, handcuffing Hooks and\n\ntaking her away from the scene.\n\n       Hooks claims that her pants fell down around her ankles as a result of this encounter and\n\nofficers would not assist her in pulling them back up. Once Hooks is handcuffed and being dragged\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\naway, the bystander who is filming is farther away from her, having been pushed back by officers,\n\nso it is unclear from the footage whether her pants had fallen down. The camera eventually loses\n\nsight of her.\n\nIII.    State and federal proceedings\n\n        Hooks was charged with the municipal offenses of failing to obey a lawful command and\n\nhindering police officers. See Warren Mun. Code, Ch. 22, Art. II § 22-22 (hindering officers and\n\nemployees), available at https://perma.cc/M78A-7VKF; id. § 22-23 (obeying lawful command of\n\npolice officers), available at https://perma.cc/M78A-7VKF. Her husband was not able to post\n\nbond immediately, so Hooks spent four days in jail. Prosecutors dismissed the charge of failing\n\nto obey a lawful command. Hooks went to trial on the charge of hindering police officers, at which\n\nBrown, Giannola, and Doe testified, and the two videos were introduced into evidence. The jury\n\nreturned a verdict of not guilty.\n\n        Hooks then filed this lawsuit against the City of Warren, the City of Warren Police\n\nDepartment, and Officers Doe, Munafo, Giannola, and Brown, as well as another officer.1 She\n\nasserted eleven causes of action under state and federal law. The district court granted summary\n\njudgment for the officers and municipal defendants on several of Hooks’s claims, but denied\n\nsummary judgment as to the following: (1) excessive force under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 as to Doe\n\n(Count 1); (2) unlawful arrest under § 1983 as to Doe and Munafo (Count II); (3) state-law battery\n\nagainst Doe (Count VII); (4) state-law intentional infliction of emotional distress against Doe and\n\nMunafo (Count IX); and (5) malicious prosecution as to Doe, Munafo, Brown, and Giannola\n\n(Count X). The officers filed this timely appeal.\n\n\n\n1\n The claims against the municipal defendants and the other officer were dismissed, and they are\nnot parties to this appeal.\n                                               -6-\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\nI.     Hooks’s § 1983 claims\n\n       The district court determined that Doe and Munafo were not entitled to qualified immunity\n\non Hooks’s two claims arising under § 1983: unlawful arrest and excessive force. To overcome a\n\nqualified-immunity defense, the plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) the facts, taken in the light\n\nmost favorable to her, show that an officer violated her constitutional right, and (2) the right was\n\nclearly established at the time of the officer’s conduct such that the officer would have understood\n\nthat he was violating the plaintiff’s rights. Tanner v. Walters, 98 F.4th 726, 731 (6th Cir. 2024).\n\nSummary judgment is properly denied when a plaintiff has offered evidence sufficient to raise a\n\ngenuine dispute of material fact as to whether the officer violated her clearly established rights.\n\nId.; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). We review de novo the district court’s denial of summary judgment\n\non qualified-immunity grounds. Tanner, 98 F.4th at 731. “An order denying summary judgment\n\nis not typically a ‘final decision’ that we have jurisdiction to review under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.”\n\nHeeter v. Bowers, 99 F.4th 900, 908 (6th Cir. 2024) (citing Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.S. 765,\n\n771 (2014)). But to the extent that the denial of summary judgment is the denial of qualified\n\nimmunity, the rules are “a bit different[].” Id. “When a defendant official is entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity . . . , it means they are entitled to not stand trial for their actions.” Id. Therefore, “[a]\n\nsummary-judgment order denying this immunity from suit is essentially a final order as to that\n\nentitlement . . . warrant[ing] immediate appeal under the collateral order doctrine.” Id. But “[a]\n\ndistrict court’s denial of qualified immunity is an appealable final decision under 28 U.S.C. § 1291\n\n. . . only ‘to the extent that it turns on an issue of law.’” Estate of Carter v. City of Detroit, 408\n\nF.3d 305, 309 (6th Cir. 2005) (quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985)).\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\n        “[C]ourts of appeals have jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a qualified-immunity denial only\n\nwhen the appeal presents a purely legal question.” Barry v. O’Grady, 895 F.3d 440, 443 (6th Cir.\n\n2018) (citing Estate of Carter, 408 F.3d at 310). As the Supreme Court made clear in Johnson v.\n\nJones, 515 U.S. 304 (1995), a defendant raising a qualified-immunity defense “may not appeal a\n\ndistrict court’s summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial\n\nrecord sets forth a ‘genuine’ issue of fact for trial.” Id. at 319-20. That is, if an appeal from denial\n\nof qualified immunity turns on a disputed issue of fact, then “we may not exercise jurisdiction.”\n\nBarry, 895 F.3d at 443 (citing Johnson, 515 U.S. at 319-20). Beyond factual determinations, “a\n\ndefendant [also] may not challenge the inferences that the district court draws from those facts, as\n\nthat too is a prohibited fact-based appeal.” Adams v. Blount County, 946 F.3d 940, 948 (6th Cir.\n\n2020) (quoting Barry, 895 F.3d at 443).\n\n        Our court has recognized two exceptions to this rule, however. First, we may exercise\n\njurisdiction and “overrule a district court’s determination that a factual dispute exists where\n\nevidence in the record establishes that the determination is blatantly and demonstrably false.”\n\nBarry, 895 F.3d at 443 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Austin v. Redford Twp. Police\n\nDep’t, 690 F.3d 490, 496 (6th Cir. 2012)). When a party’s recollection of the facts is contradicted\n\nby undisputed video or audio records, for example, we need not accept the non-movant’s version\n\nof events. See Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380-81 (2007).\n\n        Second, we may exercise jurisdiction if, despite a factual disagreement, the defendant is\n\n“willing to concede the most favorable view of the facts to the plaintiff for purposes of the appeal.”\n\nBarry, 895 F.3d at 443 (quoting Phelps v. Coy, 286 F.3d 295, 298 (6th Cir. 2002)). But the\n\nconcession must be genuine. See Anderson-Santos v. Kent County, 94 F.4th 550, 554-55 (6th Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\n2024) (declining to exercise jurisdiction where the defendant purported to concede the plaintiff’s\n\nviews, but “in effect still litigate[d] the factual dispute”).\n\n        Some of our cases have noted that we may “ignore the defendant’s attempts to dispute the\n\nfacts and nonetheless resolve the legal issue” of “whether the facts alleged support a claim of\n\nviolation of clearly established law,” and therefore avoid having to “dismiss the entire appeal for\n\nlack of jurisdiction.” Estate of Carter, 408 F.3d at 310 (cleaned up); see also Quigley v. Tuong\n\nVinh Thai, 707 F.3d 675, 680 (6th Cir. 2013) (defendant’s “improper [factual] arguments and the\n\nbasis of the district court’s decision do not necessarily prevent us from having jurisdiction over\n\n[his] appeal” (emphasis added)). But if “disputed factual issues are crucial to a defendant’s\n\ninterlocutory qualified immunity appeal, we may not simply ignore such disputes; we remain\n\nobligated to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.” Adams, 946 F.3d at 951 (cleaned up).\n\n        A.      Unlawful arrest\n\n        We first determine whether we have jurisdiction over the officers’ appeal from the denial\n\nof qualified immunity on the unlawful-arrest claim. The district court correctly noted that, to\n\nproceed to trial on this claim, Hooks needed evidence that officers lacked probable cause to arrest\n\nher for the two municipal infractions. The court reviewed the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto Hooks and concluded that “the available video evidence is not clear enough to resolve any of\n\nthe factual disputes one way or another.” RE 45, Opinion & Order, at PageID 1139. In particular,\n\nthe district court found that the dashboard video neither confirmed nor refuted whether the scene\n\nat the corner of Ford and Lorraine was “controlled or chaotic,” meaning that the district court could\n\nnot verify whether the officers were correct in asserting that fifty to one hundred people were\n\nyelling and fighting. Id. The court also noted that the video did not show clearly whether Hooks\n\nherself was yelling. Id. at PageID 1140. Next, the court found that the “footage is even less clear”\n\n\n                                                   -9-\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\nwhether Hooks was disobedient after her one-on-one encounter with Giannola, in which he called\n\nher a “white trash bitch.” Id. Although the officers claimed that Hooks screamed and riled up the\n\ncrowd when they told her to leave, the district court found that this was not captured clearly on\n\nvideo. Hooks, for her part, stated that she simply told the officers that she was going to call their\n\nsergeant and started to leave.\n\n       Next, the district court addressed Officer Brown’s command, “She can go!”, to Officers\n\nDoe and Munafo. Id. at PageID 1141. According to the district court, a jury could reasonably\n\nconclude that Doe and Munafo “ignored a directive to allow Hooks to leave,” because it was not\n\nintuitive that “She can go!” meant “Stop, you are under arrest.” Id. Finally, the district court\n\nevaluated the officers’ claim that they had probable cause to arrest Hooks when she resisted Doe’s\n\nefforts to detain her. The video footage was not clear whether Hooks was obviously resisting arrest\n\nand tried to strike Doe, or whether she “simply startled and reflexively jerked away at unexpected\n\nphysical contact.” Id. at PageID 1142.\n\n       The district court evaluated the two competing versions of the facts: “[T]he officers’\n\nversion of the events regarding the state of the scene and Hooks’s conduct” and “Hooks’s account\n\nthat she was complying with commands and simply trying to film from a distance.” Id. at PageID\n\n1141. Because the videos did not corroborate or refute either account, the district court accepted\n\nHooks’s version of the facts—as it was required to do at the summary-judgment stage—and denied\n\nqualified immunity to Doe and Munafo with respect to Hooks’s unlawful-arrest claim.\n\n       In their appellate briefing and at oral argument, Doe and Munafo purported to accept\n\nHooks’s version of the facts. Yet they maintain that they had probable cause to arrest Hooks\n\nbecause she admitted that she was ordered to leave the scene and go home at least six times, but\n\nfailed to comply. With respect to whether Hooks was walking away at the time of arrest, the\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\nofficers concede that she “initially” complied with their orders, but contend that “what actually\n\noccur[ed] here” is that Hooks stopped walking toward her truck and turned around.\n\n        The officers’ argument on appeal boils down to a factual dispute about whether Hooks was\n\nin fact leaving the scene—that is, complying with their orders—when she was arrested. The\n\nofficers argue that the district court erred in failing to recognize that Hooks turned around, so,\n\naccording to them, she was not actually leaving. Hooks does not dispute that she was told to leave,\n\nbut argues she was leaving when she was arrested. Whether Hooks was complying with orders to\n\nleave is a “crucial” fact in the unlawful-arrest analysis because one of the infractions with which\n\nshe was charged was failure to obey a lawful command. The other charge, hindering, criminalizes\n\n“resist[ing]” police “in the performance of their duties.” RE 45, Opinion & Order, at PageID 1133,\n\n1136; RE 36-4, Misdemeanor Compl., at PageID 581.\n\n        Such a dispute over a crucial factual issue deprives us of jurisdiction on this issue. See,\n\ne.g., Gillman v. City of Troy, 126 F.4th 1152, 1160 (6th Cir. 2025) (declining to exercise\n\njurisdiction where defendant was “[un]willing to genuinely concede [plaintiff’s] version of the\n\nfacts”); Gillispie, 18 F.4th at 918 (“This repeated refusal to accept [plaintiff’s] version of the facts\n\nis fatal to [the officer’s] appeal.”). Given that the officers’ arguments depend on their version of\n\nthe facts, we can exercise appellate jurisdiction only if the district court’s factual determinations\n\nare “blatantly contradicted by the record.” Scott, 550 U.S. at 380. Doe and Munafo contend that\n\nthe video footage clearly shows that Hooks disobeyed police orders and, therefore, the district\n\ncourt’s determination that a factual dispute exists is “blatantly and demonstrably false.” CA6 R.\n\n34, Reply Br., at 2, 7 (citing Austin, 690 F.3d at 496). But the videos are not clear. They do not\n\nshow us whether Hooks was warned or even understood that she would be arrested, whether she\n\nresisted Doe’s attempt to arrest her, or whether she was interfering with the investigation by\n\n\n                                                 - 11 -\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\ninciting the crowd. And a reasonable juror viewing the videos could conclude that they show\n\nHooks walking away when she was arrested, not refusing to walk away.\n\n       At oral argument, the officers took the position that Scott requires a “frame-by-frame”\n\nanalysis of the moment of arrest captured in the videos. They argue that, when viewed frame by\n\nframe, the videos show Brown gave Doe a clear directive to arrest Hooks (“She can go!”); Hooks\n\nwas surrounded on two sides by police officers; and Hooks was thus aware that she was being\n\narrested at the time that she finally complied with officers’ orders. Therefore, they argue, it is\n\nimpossible to say that Hooks was complying with orders at the time she was arrested, because she\n\nknew she was under arrest before she started to walk away.\n\n       Even if this were the only reasonable interpretation of the video (which it is not), we do\n\nnot read Scott as requiring us to analyze the video on a frame-by-frame basis. In Scott, the record\n\ncontained a video of a high-speed chase. 550 U.S. at 378. The Supreme Court summarized the\n\nvideo as depicting the totality of events: a car “racing down narrow, two-lane roads,” “swerv[ing]\n\naround more than a dozen other cars,” “run[ning] multiple red lights,” and so on, over\n\n“considerable periods of time.” Id. at 379-80. This led the Court to conclude that the lower court\n\nwas wrong to characterize the driver as “cautious and controlled.” Id. at 380. In other words, the\n\ncourt of appeals had interpreted the video incorrectly. Id. at 379-80. But the Court did not instruct\n\nlower courts to view videos in cases like this one on a “frame-by-frame” basis.\n\n       And we have previously rejected such an approach. For example, in Cunningham v. Shelby\n\nCounty, 994 F.3d 761 (6th Cir. 2021), an excessive-force case, the district court had relied on\n\n“screen shots” of dashcam recordings in analyzing a shooting. Id. at 763. We held that the district\n\ncourt erred in relying on these screen shots to decide whether it was objectively reasonable for\n\nofficers to use lethal force, because the officers’ perspective “did not include leisurely stop-action\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\nviewing of the real-time situation that they encountered.” Id. at 766-67. Doing so, we reasoned,\n\n“would violate the teaching of Graham [v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989),] against judging the\n\nreasonableness of a particular use of force based upon 20/20 hindsight.” Id. at 766. Under\n\nCunningham, then, we should be reluctant to use a “frame-by-frame” analysis of a videotape for\n\npurposes of the qualified immunity inquiry. Accord Longoria v. Pinal County, 873 F.3d 699, 706-\n\n08 (9th Cir. 2017) (in excessive-force claim, deputy’s reliance on a single “frozen frame” of video\n\nto justify use of force did not provide basis to grant summary judgment in his favor; deputy did\n\nnot see a frozen frame, but rather saw events as they unfolded in real time). Viewing the videos\n\nin this case as a whole, as the Court did in Scott, Hooks’s version of events is not “utterly\n\ndiscredited.” Scott, 550 U.S. at 380. So the exception articulated in Scott does not permit us to\n\noverrule the district court’s factual determinations.\n\n       Because Doe and Munafo’s arguments rely on their version of the facts, and because the\n\ndistrict court’s determinations are not blatantly contradicted by the record, we lack jurisdiction to\n\nresolve their appeal as to the denial of qualified immunity for the federal unlawful-arrest claim.\n\n       B.      Excessive force\n\n       For similar reasons, we also lack appellate jurisdiction as to Doe’s qualified-immunity\n\ndefense to the excessive-force claim. The district court correctly noted that Hooks’s excessive-\n\nforce claim hinges on whether the defendants’ use of force was “objectively reasonable.” RE 45,\n\nOpinion & Order, at PageID 1145 (quoting Graham, 490 U.S. at 397). In applying that standard,\n\nthe court properly considered the following factors: “(1) the severity of the crime at issue;\n\n(2) whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others; and\n\n(3) whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.” Id.\n\n(citing Sigley v. City of Parma Heights, 437 F.3d 527, 534 (6th Cir. 2006)).\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\n        First, as to the severity of the crime, the district court noted that Hooks was arrested for\n\nmunicipal infractions only, not violent or serious crimes. Id. at 1146. Next, the district court\n\nconcluded that Hooks posed no threat to the safety of officers: she was an unarmed, 150-pound,\n\n57-year-old woman, who was apparently leaving (that is, complying with officers’ commands)\n\nwhen she was arrested. Id. at PageID 1146-47. Finally, the district court found that the video\n\nevidence was unclear as to whether Hooks’s arm movement in reaction to being arrested could be\n\nfairly interpreted as resisting arrest. Id. at PageID 1147. Officer Doe testified that he had said to\n\nHooks, “You’re going to jail,” and she reacted in a “fighter’s stance,” but Hooks testified that Doe\n\ngave no such warning, instead grabbing at her and causing her to reflexively startle before he\n\nslammed her to the ground. Id. After having reviewed the video, the district court could not say\n\nwith certainty that Hooks’s reaction when Doe put his hands on her could have reasonably made\n\nDoe believe that any “startled” movement was an attempt to strike him. Id. at PageID 1147-48.\n\nRather, a reasonable juror could conclude that Hooks did not clearly resist Doe and, therefore, his\n\n“decision to slam her on the ground when she startled at his physical contact was unreasonable\n\nand excessive.” Id. at PageID 1148.\n\n        On appeal, much like with the unlawful-arrest claim, the officers do not concede the facts\n\nin the light most favorable to Hooks. First, they again challenge the district court’s conclusion that\n\nHooks appeared to be complying with officers’ orders to leave, and they argue that her\n\ndisobedience provided probable cause for Doe to arrest her. Second, with respect to whether\n\nHooks resisted arrest or posed a threat, the officers argue that the district court ignored the fact that\n\nDoe perceived Hooks’s actions as threatening and that his perception was reasonable under the\n\ncircumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 14 -\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\n       As to the first argument, like in the unlawful-arrest claim, the officers’ argument hinges on\n\ntheir position that Hooks was not complying with orders to leave when she was arrested. This is\n\na factual disagreement. And whether Hooks was complying with orders to leave is a “crucial” fact\n\nin the excessive-force analysis, because it bears on (1) the severity of the crime at issue (that is,\n\nwhether Hooks committed any crime at all if she was complying with orders) and (2) whether\n\nHooks posed a threat to officers if she was seemingly complying with orders. See Adams, 946\n\nF.3d at 951.\n\n       As to the second argument, the district court did not ignore the argument that Doe perceived\n\nHooks’s actions as threatening. The court acknowledged that the officers would be entitled to\n\nqualified immunity “if they could reasonably interpret any of Hooks’s actions as an attempt at\n\nresistance during a chaotic scene.” RE 45, Opinion & Order, PageID 1147. So, the court allowed\n\nfor consideration of Doe’s perceptions. But the video footage did not make it “readily apparent”\n\nthat Hooks’s reflexive arm movements were such that Doe reasonably could have mistaken them\n\nas a threat. Id. at PageID 1147-48. Thus, “[a] reasonable juror viewing the footage could conclude\n\n. . . that Doe’s [actions were] unreasonable and excessive.” Id. at PageID 1148.\n\n       On appeal, the officers challenge these factual inferences that the district court drew. This\n\nstrips us of jurisdiction to review the denial of qualified immunity for the excessive-force claim.\n\n“[A] defendant may not challenge the inferences that the district court draws from [the] facts, as\n\nthat too is a prohibited fact-based appeal.” Barry, 895 F.3d at 443 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Gillispie, 18 F.4th at 917 (where nearly all of officer’s arguments on appeal\n\nconsisted of disagreements with not only the plaintiff’s facts, but also with “the district court’s\n\ndeterminations that multiple genuine disputes of material fact exist[ed],” such challenges were\n\n\n\n\n                                               - 15 -\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\n“unreviewable” on interlocutory appeal). Thus, we dismiss the appeal as to the federal excessive-\n\nforce claim.\n\nII.    Hooks’s state-law claims\n\n       Hooks’s remaining claims—battery, malicious prosecution,2 and intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress—all arise under Michigan state law. The officers ask us to exercise pendent\n\nappellate jurisdiction over these state-law claims.\n\n       “Pendent appellate jurisdiction refers to the exercise of jurisdiction over issues that\n\nordinarily may not be reviewed on interlocutory appeal, but[] may be reviewed on interlocutory\n\nappeal if those issues are ‘inextricably intertwined’ with matters over which the appellate court\n\nproperly and independently has jurisdiction.” Summers v. Leis, 368 F.3d 881, 889 (6th Cir. 2004)\n\n(quoting Chambers v. Ohio Dep’t of Human Servs., 145 F.3d 793, 797 (6th Cir. 1998)). But, as\n\nset forth above, we lack jurisdiction over the officers’ appeal of Hooks’s federal § 1983 claims, so\n\nthe officers cannot succeed on their pendent appellate jurisdiction argument as to the state-law\n\nclaims. Cate v. City of Rockwood, 241 F. App’x 231, 237 (6th Cir. 2007) (per curiam) (“Exercise\n\nof pendent jurisdiction requires proper jurisdiction over the qualified immunity issue.” (citation\n\nomitted)). The officers have presented no other basis for us to consider these claims on appeal.\n\nWe therefore dismiss the state-law claims for lack of pendent appellate jurisdiction.\n\n                                             CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings in the district court.\n\n\n2\n  Although the district court appeared to analyze the malicious-prosecution claim as one “under\nthe Fourth Amendment that is distinct from a claim for false arrest,” see RE 45, Opinion & Order,\nat PageID 1155 (citing Sykes v. Anderson, 625 F.3d 294, 308 (6th Cir. 2010)), Hooks’s complaint\ncited Michigan law in support of this claim. Hooks clarified at oral argument that she brought this\nclaim under state law only.\n                                                - 16 -\n\f",

In April 2019, 57-year-old Nancy Hooks stopped her car in Warren,\n\nMichigan to assist a teenage victim of a street fight. She stayed on the scene to help police officers\n\nlocate the mob who had beaten him. Police officers dismissed her help, calling her a “white trash\n\nbitch.” Hooks then pulled out her cell phone and walked away, apparently to film the officers.\n\nThe police chased after her, telling her to leave. But as Hooks was walking away, an officer\n\napproached her, causing her to throw up her arm. The officer slammed Hooks to the ground,\n\nhandcuffed her, and took her away.\n\n       Hooks was prosecuted in Michigan state court for “hindering,” and a jury acquitted her.\n\nShe then sued the officers, the City of Warren, and the Warren Police Department in federal court,\n\nalleging claims under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">42 U.S.C. § 1983</span><pre class=\"inline\"> and Michigan law. The defendants moved for summary\n\njudgment on various grounds, and the district court granted in part and denied in part their motion.\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\nThe officers now appeal the portions of the order denying them summary judgment. For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remand for further\n\nproceedings in the district court.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       Where the district court has “correctly applied the standard for summary judgment” in a\n\n§ 1983 case, we may “adopt the district court’s recitation of the facts, including casting them in\n\nthe light most favorable to” the plaintiff. Gillispie v. Miami Township, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">18 F.4th 909</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 912 (6th Cir.\n\n2021) (citations omitted). We do so here.\n\n       In the early evening of April 8, 2019, Nancy Hooks, then 57 years old, was driving south\n\non Lorraine Avenue in Warren, Michigan, to visit a friend. While en route, Hooks saw police cars\n\nleaving the intersection of Lorraine and Ford Street. Hooks stopped her car to speak with another\n\nfriend who was standing near the intersection, and this friend told her that the police had arrested\n\nsomeone for shooting a gun. Not long after Hooks stopped, a group of fifteen to twenty teenagers\n\nran through the intersection and started beating a teenage boy.\n\n       Hooks reported the altercation to 911 and got out of her truck to tell the boy that help was\n\non the way. Meanwhile, the group of teenagers ran away. Approximately five minutes after Hooks\n\ncalled 911, police and other first responders arrived.      Responding police officers included\n\ndefendant-appellant Officers Marchelloe Brown, Anthony Giannola, Lucas Doe, and Bryan\n\nMunafo.\n\n       What happened after police officers converged on the scene at Lorraine and Ford is the\n\nsubject of dispute. Some of what occurred is captured in two videos: dashcam footage from\n\nBrown’s police car and cellphone footage taken by a bystander. Neither of these videos completely\n\n\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\ncorroborates either party’s account, but they are useful in determining what happened and where\n\nthe parties’ stories diverge.\n\nI.      The dashcam video\n\n        Brown’s dashcam video footage shows approximately ten to fifteen people, including\n\nofficers, when he arrived at the intersection of Ford and Lorraine. Brown claims that, when he\n\narrived, there were “well in excess of 100 people” on the scene “arguing with officers.” RE 36-3,\n\nTrial Tr. – Vol. 1, at PageID 454. He also claims that “fights were breaking out” and that he had\n\nto “assist other officers.” RE 36-10, Brown Dep., at PageID 682. For her part, Hooks claims there\n\nwere no other fights or shouting happening when officers arrived and only between thirty to forty\n\npeople present. Because of its limited vantage point, the dashcam footage does not confirm or\n\nrefute either account.\n\n        The dashcam video then shows Brown and Giannola walking toward the group of people\n\nclustered at the intersection. Hooks, who is wearing a pink shirt and a dark jacket, approaches\n\nthem. Hooks tells the officers that she was a witness to the fight. The officers instruct her to move\n\nto the side so that they can make sure nobody has a weapon, and Hooks responds: “You’re not\n\neven looking for the kids. . . . They’re already on that block right there.” Ex. 11 to Defs.’ Mot. for\n\nSumm. J., at 05:00-18.

Hooks then tells\n\nthe officers again that she was a witness to the fight and the location where the group of teenagers\n\nran.\n\n        As this exchange occurs, another woman comes up to the group to tell officers that they\n\nnearly hit her and her daughter with one of their cars.

The dashcam video then shows people leaving the intersection, but Hooks stays behind\n\nto try to continue to speak with officers. At one point, she goes over to speak with a motorcyclist\n\nin the intersection, and then returns to the huddled officers.\n\n       Finally, Hooks is able to approach Giannola one-on-one in the intersection. The two appear\n\nto speak. Hooks then backs up from Giannola and walks past him as if to walk away. Next, she\n\nturns as if she has heard him say something to her and says, “Bitch? White trash?” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id.</span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 07:20-\n\n49. In her deposition, Hooks testified that Giannola called her a “white trash bitch.” RE 36-12,\n\nHooks Dep., at PageID 752. On the video, Hooks is told to “go home” and “walk away,” but\n\nHooks says that she is “57 years old, [and] you’re not gonna call me white trash.” Ex. 11 to Defs.’\n\nMot. for Summ. J., at 07:49-57.\n\n       Hooks then walks away from the officers toward a small group of approximately five\n\npeople who are standing on the corner. She takes out her phone and tells the officers that she is\n\ngoing to call their sergeant. Officers tell her to “go home” and to “[k]nock yourself out.” </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at\n\n08:06-30</span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n       Hooks next walks away from the group of officers and toward her truck.

The bystander video\n\n       Cellphone footage taken from a different angle by a bystander provides a somewhat clearer\n\nview of Hooks in this latter minute. This video also shows approximately seven to ten people on\n\nthe street corners (aside from police officers) after the crowd has thinned out. On the video, Hooks\n\nwalks backwards away from officers, speaks to people standing in a yard, and then takes out her\n\nphone. The camera pans away, but when it returns to Hooks, she is standing in the street across\n\nfrom the police officers and we can see an officer approach and say something to her. Hooks\n\nwalks away from the officer; she then stops, turns around, and pulls out her cellphone to film. The\n\nbystander moves closer to Hooks. Officers chase Hooks and yell, “Go!”, at which point Hooks\n\nturns around with her phone lowered and walks away. Ex. 12 to Defs.’ Mot. for Summ. J., at 0:48-\n\n50. The camera then pans away again.

One cannot tell from the video whether he says anything to her.\n\nHooks pulls away and raises her left hand—in what she characterizes as a startle or reflex and what\n\nDoe took to be a fighting stance. Doe then grabs Hooks around her collarbone, pulls her down\n\nbackwards onto the ground, and gets on top of her. Bystanders are immediately heard saying,\n\n“Hey, hey!

The camera eventually loses\n\nsight of her.\n\nIII.    State and federal proceedings\n\n        Hooks was charged with the municipal offenses of failing to obey a lawful command and\n\nhindering police officers. See Warren Mun. Code, Ch. 22, Art. II § 22-22 (hindering officers and\n\nemployees), available at https://perma.cc/M78A-7VKF; id. § 22-23 (obeying lawful command of\n\npolice officers), available at https://perma.cc/M78A-7VKF. Her husband was not able to post\n\nbond immediately, so Hooks spent four days in jail. Prosecutors dismissed the charge of failing\n\nto obey a lawful command. Hooks went to trial on the charge of hindering police officers, at which\n\nBrown, Giannola, and Doe testified, and the two videos were introduced into evidence. The jury\n\nreturned a verdict of not guilty.\n\n        Hooks then filed this lawsuit against the City of Warren, the City of Warren Police\n\nDepartment, and Officers Doe, Munafo, Giannola, and Brown, as well as another officer.1 She\n\nasserted eleven causes of action under state and federal law. The district court granted summary\n\njudgment for the officers and municipal defendants on several of Hooks’s claims, but denied\n\nsummary judgment as to the following: (1) excessive force under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">42 U.S.C. § 1983</span><pre class=\"inline\"> as to Doe\n\n(Count 1); (2) unlawful arrest under § 1983 as to Doe and Munafo (Count II); (3) state-law battery\n\nagainst Doe (Count VII); (4) state-law intentional infliction of emotional distress against Doe and\n\nMunafo (Count IX); and (5) malicious prosecution as to Doe, Munafo, Brown, and Giannola\n\n(Count X). The officers filed this timely appeal.\n\n\n\n1\n The claims against the municipal defendants and the other officer were dismissed, and they are\nnot parties to this appeal.\n                                               -6-\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\n                                            ANALYSIS\n\nI.     Hooks’s § 1983 claims\n\n       The district court determined that Doe and Munafo were not entitled to qualified immunity\n\non Hooks’s two claims arising under § 1983: unlawful arrest and excessive force. To overcome a\n\nqualified-immunity defense, the plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) the facts, taken in the light\n\nmost favorable to her, show that an officer violated her constitutional right, and (2) the right was\n\nclearly established at the time of the officer’s conduct such that the officer would have understood\n\nthat he was violating the plaintiff’s rights. Tanner v. Walters, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">98 F.4th 726</span><pre class=\"inline\">, 731 (6th Cir. 2024).\n\nSummary judgment is properly denied when a plaintiff has offered evidence sufficient to raise a\n\ngenuine dispute of material fact as to whether the officer violated her clearly established rights.\n\nId.; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). We review de novo the district court’s denial of summary judgment\n\non qualified-immunity grounds. Tanner, 98 F.4th at 731. “An order denying summary judgment\n\nis not typically a ‘final decision’ that we have jurisdiction to review under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">28 U.S.C. § 1291</span><pre class=\"inline\">.”\n\nHeeter v.

But if “disputed factual issues are crucial to a defendant’s\n\ninterlocutory qualified immunity appeal, we may not simply ignore such disputes; we remain\n\nobligated to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.” Adams, 946 F.3d at 951 (cleaned up).\n\n        A.      Unlawful arrest\n\n        We first determine whether we have jurisdiction over the officers’ appeal from the denial\n\nof qualified immunity on the unlawful-arrest claim. The district court correctly noted that, to\n\nproceed to trial on this claim, Hooks needed evidence that officers lacked probable cause to arrest\n\nher for the two municipal infractions. The court reviewed the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto Hooks and concluded that “the available video evidence is not clear enough to resolve any of\n\nthe factual disputes one way or another.” RE 45, Opinion &amp; Order, at PageID 1139. In particular,\n\nthe district court found that the dashboard video neither confirmed nor refuted whether the scene\n\nat the corner of Ford and Lorraine was “controlled or chaotic,” meaning that the district court could\n\nnot verify whether the officers were correct in asserting that fifty to one hundred people were\n\nyelling and fighting. Id. The court also noted that the video did not show clearly whether Hooks\n\nherself was yelling. Id. at PageID 1140. Next, the court found that the “footage is even less clear”\n\n\n                                                   -9-\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\nwhether Hooks was disobedient after her one-on-one encounter with Giannola, in which he called\n\nher a “white trash bitch.” Id. Although the officers claimed that Hooks screamed and riled up the\n\ncrowd when they told her to leave, the district court found that this was not captured clearly on\n\nvideo. Hooks, for her part, stated that she simply told the officers that she was going to call their\n\nsergeant and started to leave.\n\n       Next, the district court addressed Officer Brown’s command, “She can go!”, to Officers\n\nDoe and Munafo. Id. at PageID 1141. According to the district court, a jury could reasonably\n\nconclude that Doe and Munafo “ignored a directive to allow Hooks to leave,” because it was not\n\nintuitive that “She can go!” meant “Stop, you are under arrest.” Id. Finally, the district court\n\nevaluated the officers’ claim that they had probable cause to arrest Hooks when she resisted Doe’s\n\nefforts to detain her. The video footage was not clear whether Hooks was obviously resisting arrest\n\nand tried to strike Doe, or whether she “simply startled and reflexively jerked away at unexpected\n\nphysical contact.” Id. at PageID 1142.\n\n       The district court evaluated the two competing versions of the facts: “[T]he officers’\n\nversion of the events regarding the state of the scene and Hooks’s conduct” and “Hooks’s account\n\nthat she was complying with commands and simply trying to film from a distance.” Id. at PageID\n\n1141. Because the videos did not corroborate or refute either account, the district court accepted\n\nHooks’s version of the facts—as it was required to do at the summary-judgment stage—and denied\n\nqualified immunity to Doe and Munafo with respect to Hooks’s unlawful-arrest claim.\n\n       In their appellate briefing and at oral argument, Doe and Munafo purported to accept\n\nHooks’s version of the facts. Yet they maintain that they had probable cause to arrest Hooks\n\nbecause she admitted that she was ordered to leave the scene and go home at least six times, but\n\nfailed to comply. With respect to whether Hooks was walking away at the time of arrest, the\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\nofficers concede that she “initially” complied with their orders, but contend that “what actually\n\noccur[ed] here” is that Hooks stopped walking toward her truck and turned around.\n\n        The officers’ argument on appeal boils down to a factual dispute about whether Hooks was\n\nin fact leaving the scene—that is, complying with their orders—when she was arrested. The\n\nofficers argue that the district court erred in failing to recognize that Hooks turned around, so,\n\naccording to them, she was not actually leaving. Hooks does not dispute that she was told to leave,\n\nbut argues she was leaving when she was arrested. Whether Hooks was complying with orders to\n\nleave is a “crucial” fact in the unlawful-arrest analysis because one of the infractions with which\n\nshe was charged was failure to obey a lawful command. The other charge, hindering, criminalizes\n\n“resist[ing]” police “in the performance of their duties.” RE 45, Opinion &amp; Order, at PageID 1133,\n\n1136; RE 36-4, Misdemeanor Compl., at PageID 581.\n\n        Such a dispute over a crucial factual issue deprives us of jurisdiction on this issue.

And a reasonable juror viewing the videos could conclude that they show\n\nHooks walking away when she was arrested, not refusing to walk away.\n\n       At oral argument, the officers took the position that Scott requires a “frame-by-frame”\n\nanalysis of the moment of arrest captured in the videos. They argue that, when viewed frame by\n\nframe, the videos show Brown gave Doe a clear directive to arrest Hooks (“She can go!”); Hooks\n\nwas surrounded on two sides by police officers; and Hooks was thus aware that she was being\n\narrested at the time that she finally complied with officers’ orders. Therefore, they argue, it is\n\nimpossible to say that Hooks was complying with orders at the time she was arrested, because she\n\nknew she was under arrest before she started to walk away.\n\n       Even if this were the only reasonable interpretation of the video (which it is not), we do\n\nnot read Scott as requiring us to analyze the video on a frame-by-frame basis. In Scott, the record\n\ncontained a video of a high-speed chase. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9435077\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/#378\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Scott v.

The Supreme Court summarized the\n\nvideo as depicting the totality of events: a car “racing down narrow, two-lane roads,” “swerv[ing]\n\naround more than a dozen other cars,” “run[ning] multiple red lights,” and so on, over\n\n“considerable periods of time.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9435077\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/#379\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Scott v.

But the Court did not instruct\n\nlower courts to view videos in cases like this one on a “frame-by-frame” basis.\n\n       And we have previously rejected such an approach. For example, in Cunningham v. Shelby\n\nCounty, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">994 F.3d 761</span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2021), an excessive-force case, the district court had relied on\n\n“screen shots” of dashcam recordings in analyzing a shooting. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\">Id. at 763</span><pre class=\"inline\">. We held that the district\n\ncourt erred in relying on these screen shots to decide whether it was objectively reasonable for\n\nofficers to use lethal force, because the officers’ perspective “did not include leisurely stop-action\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v.

Doing so, we reasoned,\n\n“would violate the teaching of Graham [v.

Under\n\nCunningham, then, we should be reluctant to use a “frame-by-frame” analysis of a videotape for\n\npurposes of the qualified immunity inquiry. Accord Longoria v.

Viewing the videos\n\nin this case as a whole, as the Court did in Scott, Hooks’s version of events is not “utterly\n\ndiscredited.” Scott, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9435077\"><a href=\"/opinion/145738/scott-v-harris/#380\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Scott v. Harris\">550 U.S. at 380</a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. So the exception articulated in Scott does not permit us to\n\noverrule the district court’s factual determinations.\n\n       Because Doe and Munafo’s arguments rely on their version of the facts, and because the\n\ndistrict court’s determinations are not blatantly contradicted by the record, we lack jurisdiction to\n\nresolve their appeal as to the denial of qualified immunity for the federal unlawful-arrest claim.\n\n       B.      Excessive force\n\n       For similar reasons, we also lack appellate jurisdiction as to Doe’s qualified-immunity\n\ndefense to the excessive-force claim. The district court correctly noted that Hooks’s excessive-\n\nforce claim hinges on whether the defendants’ use of force was “objectively reasonable.” RE 45,\n\nOpinion &amp; Order, at PageID 1145 (quoting Graham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9431666\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/#397\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Graham v.

In applying that standard,\n\nthe court properly considered the following factors: “(1) the severity of the crime at issue;\n\n(2) whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others; and\n\n(3) whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9431666\"><a href=\"/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Graham v.

City of Warren, et al.\n\n\n        First, as to the severity of the crime, the district court noted that Hooks was arrested for\n\nmunicipal infractions only, not violent or serious crimes. Id. at 1146. Next, the district court\n\nconcluded that Hooks posed no threat to the safety of officers: she was an unarmed, 150-pound,\n\n57-year-old woman, who was apparently leaving (that is, complying with officers’ commands)\n\nwhen she was arrested. Id. at PageID 1146-47. Finally, the district court found that the video\n\nevidence was unclear as to whether Hooks’s arm movement in reaction to being arrested could be\n\nfairly interpreted as resisting arrest. Id. at PageID 1147. Officer Doe testified that he had said to\n\nHooks, “You’re going to jail,” and she reacted in a “fighter’s stance,” but Hooks testified that Doe\n\ngave no such warning, instead grabbing at her and causing her to reflexively startle before he\n\nslammed her to the ground. Id. After having reviewed the video, the district court could not say\n\nwith certainty that Hooks’s reaction when Doe put his hands on her could have reasonably made\n\nDoe believe that any “startled” movement was an attempt to strike him. Id. at PageID 1147-48.\n\nRather, a reasonable juror could conclude that Hooks did not clearly resist Doe and, therefore, his\n\n“decision to slam her on the ground when she startled at his physical contact was unreasonable\n\nand excessive.” Id. at PageID 1148.\n\n        On appeal, much like with the unlawful-arrest claim, the officers do not concede the facts\n\nin the light most favorable to Hooks. First, they again challenge the district court’s conclusion that\n\nHooks appeared to be complying with officers’ orders to leave, and they argue that her\n\ndisobedience provided probable cause for Doe to arrest her. Second, with respect to whether\n\nHooks resisted arrest or posed a threat, the officers argue that the district court ignored the fact that\n\nDoe perceived Hooks’s actions as threatening and that his perception was reasonable under the\n\ncircumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 - 14 -\n\fNo. 24-1375, Hooks v. City of Warren, et al.\n\n\n       As to the first argument, like in the unlawful-arrest claim, the officers’ argument hinges on\n\ntheir position that Hooks was not complying with orders to leave when she was arrested. This is\n\na factual disagreement. And whether Hooks was complying with orders to leave is a “crucial” fact\n\nin the excessive-force analysis, because it bears on (1) the severity of the crime at issue (that is,\n\nwhether Hooks committed any crime at all if she was complying with orders) and (2) whether\n\nHooks posed a threat to officers if she was seemingly complying with orders. See Adams, 946\n\nF.3d at 951.\n\n       As to the second argument, the district court did not ignore the argument that Doe perceived\n\nHooks’s actions as threatening. The court acknowledged that the officers would be entitled to\n\nqualified immunity “if they could reasonably interpret any of Hooks’s actions as an attempt at\n\nresistance during a chaotic scene.” RE 45, Opinion &amp; Order, PageID 1147. So, the court allowed\n\nfor consideration of Doe’s perceptions. But the video footage did not make it “readily apparent”\n\nthat Hooks’s reflexive arm movements were such that Doe reasonably could have mistaken them\n\nas a threat. Id. at PageID 1147-48. Thus, “[a] reasonable juror viewing the footage could conclude\n\n. . . that Doe’s [actions were] unreasonable and excessive.” Id. at PageID 1148.\n\n       On appeal, the officers challenge these factual inferences that the district court drew. This\n\nstrips us of jurisdiction to review the denial of qualified immunity for the excessive-force claim.\n\n“[A] defendant may not challenge the inferences that the district court draws from [the] facts, as\n\nthat too is a prohibited fact-based appeal.” Barry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9886809\"><a href=\"/opinion/4515941/teresa-barry-v-james-ogrady/#443\" aria-description=\"Citation for case: Teresa Barry v.

Hooks’s state-law claims\n\n       Hooks’s remaining claims—battery, malicious prosecution,2 and intentional infliction of\n\nemotional distress—all arise under Michigan state law. The officers ask us to exercise pendent\n\nappellate jurisdiction over these state-law claims.\n\n       “Pendent appellate jurisdiction refers to the exercise of jurisdiction over issues that\n\nordinarily may not be reviewed on interlocutory appeal, but[] may be reviewed on interlocutory\n\nappeal if those issues are ‘inextricably intertwined’ with matters over which the appellate court\n\nproperly and independently has jurisdiction.” Summers v.

STAT. § 752.31(2)(c) (2023-24).\nAll references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 2023-24 version.\n\f                                                                                    No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\noperating with a prohibited alcohol concentration, as a first offense, and separately\nfound that Erickson had unreasonably refused to submit to a chemical test of his\nbreath following his arrest. Erickson challenges the court’s denial of his motion to\nsuppress evidence. Erickson argues that there was not sufficient evidence to\njustify a request by police that he submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT) before\nhis arrest. Erickson also contends that there was not sufficient evidence to support\nprobable cause to arrest him. I reject these arguments and accordingly affirm.2\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n        ¶2      City of Monona police cited Erickson with operating a motor vehicle\nwhile intoxicated in violation of WIS. STAT. § 346.63(1)(a) and operating with\nprohibited alcohol concentration in violation of § 346.63(1)(b). The police also\ngave Erickson a notice of intent to revoke his operating privileges for allegedly\nrefusing to submit to a chemical test of his breath after his arrest under\nWisconsin’s implied consent law. See WIS. STAT. § 343.305.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n            The City of Monona cross appeals, but I need not address the cross appeal. Explaining\nfurther, the City challenges the circuit court’s determination that Erickson was not guilty of\noperating under the influence of an intoxicant on the ground that there is “no evidence in the\nrecord to support a not guilty verdict.” The City states that its cross appeal is “protective,” by\nwhich it means that the cross appeal is intended to preserve an argument that, if Erickson is\nsuccessful in his appeal of the prohibited alcohol concentration conviction, the City should be\nallowed to pursue a judgment against Erickson for operating under the influence of an intoxicant\nand a corresponding sentence. See State v. McAdory, 2024 WI App 29, ¶32, 412 Wis. 2d 112, 8\nN.W.3d 101, review granted, 2024 WI 40, 414 Wis. 2d 187, 15 N.W.3d 24 (discussing\nmunicipality’s failure to file protective cross appeal in Town of Menasha v.

Because I reject Erickson’s challenge to the prohibited alcohol concentration\ncitation, there is no need to reach the City’s cross appeal. See Dickman v. Vollmer, 2007 WI App\n141, ¶3, 303 Wis. 2d 241, 736 N.W.2d 202.\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\f                                                                          No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶3     Erickson was found guilty of both offenses in municipal court.\nThere is no dispute that Erickson timely demanded a hearing on the refusal\nallegation. He appealed for a trial de novo in the circuit court.\n\n       ¶4     In circuit court, Erickson filed a motion to suppress evidence\nobtained as a result of what he alleged was an unlawful request that he undergo a\nPBT. In the alternative, he moved to suppress evidence later obtained following\nhis arrest on the ground that the arrest was unlawful.\n\n       ¶5     The circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on Erickson’s motion.\nIt was established that Erickson entered a retail store on the night of January 28,\n2020, and asked to borrow or purchase a shovel to dig his car out of some sort of\nsnow accumulation in a nearby parking lot. Store employees did not give him a\nshovel. A manager of the store testified that, based on observations of Erickson\nduring this encounter, the manager believed that Erickson was drunk, and the\nmanager called the police to report suspicion of an intoxicated driver.\n\n       ¶6     The two officers who were dispatched in response, Jared Wedig and\nLandon Flora, testified in pertinent part as follows. Wedig and Flora went to a\nparking lot near the store, where the officers encountered Erickson, who was by\nhimself. Erickson was attempting to use an umbrella to dig a car out of several\ninches of snow that had accumulated on that portion of the lot.\n\n       ¶7     Both officers smelled the odor of alcohol on Erickson’s breath,\nnoticed that his speech was slurred, and observed that Erickson had parked his car\nin an unplowed portion of the parking lot, which was well-lit, despite the fact that\na significant portion of the parking lot had been plowed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n        ¶8      The officers requested that Erickson undergo a PBT.                     Erickson\ninitially consented to do this, but he did not provide a breath sample sufficient to\ncreate a meaningful result. The officers continued to talk with Erickson for a time,\nand then placed him in handcuffs and moved him to the front of one of the\nofficers’ squad cars. This was because, according to Wedig, Erickson was “trying\n[to] play games or at least prolong the process” of determining whether Erickson\nwas impaired for purposes of operating a motor vehicle. The officers requested\nthat Erickson take the PBT again, but he declined. The officers then requested that\nErickson undergo field sobriety tests, which he also declined.\n\n        ¶9      Officers Wedig and Flora both recorded their interactions with\nErickson on body cameras. Portions of these recordings were played during the\nhearing and are preserved in the record on appeal.\n\n        ¶10     On July 26, 2023, the circuit court issued a written decision denying\nErickson’s motion. As part of its analysis, the court fully credited the testimony of\nthe store manager and the officers.\n\n        ¶11     The circuit court held a bench trial on the citations, which also\nserved as the refusal hearing.3 The store manager and the two police officers again\ntestified, with Officer Flora’s testimony now additionally covering events after\nErickson’s arrest. This included testimony that Flora read to Erickson from an\n“informing the accused” form, that Erickson refused to submit to a chemical test\nof his breath, and that Flora then obtained a warrant to test Erickson’s blood. A\nphlebotomist testified regarding a blood sample that she took from Erickson after\n\n        3\n          Erickson moved for a jury trial, which the circuit court denied in a ruling that Erickson\ndoes not challenge on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nhe was transported by police to an area hospital. Further, an employee of the state\ncrime laboratory testified regarding the testing of the blood sample, which\nreflected a blood alcohol concentration of .092 grams per 100 milliliters.\n\n       ¶12    The circuit court found Erickson not guilty of operating while under\nthe influence and guilty of operating with a prohibited alcohol concentration. The\ncourt further found that Erickson had refused, after his arrest, to submit to the\nrequested chemical test of his breath and that it was unreasonable for him to do so.\n\n       ¶13    Erickson appeals.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\n       ¶14    As noted, Erickson argues that the officers lacked the necessary level\nof probable cause to request that he undergo a PBT, and he further argues in the\nalternative that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him. I apply the\nfollowing standards of review to both issues.\n\n       ¶15    This court will “uphold the trial court’s findings of fact unless they\nare clearly erroneous.    Whether those facts satisfy the statutory standard of\nprobable cause is a question of law we review de novo.” County of Jefferson v.\nRenz, 231 Wis. 2d 293, 316, 603 N.W.2d 541 (1999) (citations omitted)\n(concluding that investigating officer had probable cause to request a PBT).\n\n       I. Request for PBT\n\n       ¶16    Erickson argues that the City failed to show that the officers had\n“probable cause to believe” that Erickson was operating under the influence or had\na prohibited alcohol concentration, which by statute was required before they\ncould lawfully request that he submit to a PBT. See WIS. STAT. § 343.303; State\n\n\n                                         5\n\f                                                                       No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nv. Felton, 2012 WI App 114, ¶¶7-8, 344 Wis. 2d 483, 824 N.W.2d 871. “Probable\ncause to believe” is a quantum of proof that is “‘greater than the reasonable\nsuspicion necessary to justify an investigative stop … but less than the level of\nproof required to establish probable cause for arrest.’” See Felton, 344 Wis. 2d\n483, ¶8 (quoting Renz, 231 Wis. 2d at 316).           Although it is unclear from\nErickson’s briefing, I understand his argument to be that the officers violated\n§ 343.303 from the moment that they first requested that Erickson submit to a PBT\nbecause they lacked the requisite level of probable cause. I conclude that, when\nthe officers requested that Erickson submit to a PBT, the information that was\nobjectively available to the officers exceeded the amount of evidence necessary to\njustify that request.\n\n       ¶17     The following facts support probable cause to believe that Erickson\ncommitted a drunk driving offense at the time the officers requested that he submit\nto a PBT. No one piece of evidence was especially strong or dispositive, but\ntogether they easily meet the legal standard. See State v. Post, 2007 WI 60, ¶¶36-\n38, 301 Wis. 2d 1, 733 N.W.2d 634 (weaving within a lane constituted “poor\ndriving” that, accumulated with other relevant facts, supported conclusion that\nofficer had reasonable suspicion of drunk driving).\n\n       ¶18     Unusual conduct regarding snow bank. There is no dispute that\nErickson appeared to have driven his car onto an unplowed area of the parking lot,\nmaking it necessary for him to dig it out.      This was despite the fact that a\nsubstantial portion of the well-lit lot had been plowed. Then, he was found trying\nto dig out the car with an umbrella. All of these facts could reasonably have been\nviewed as possible indications of impaired judgment due to the effects of\noverconsumption of alcohol.\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f                                                                         No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶19    Smell of alcohol. The circuit court credited the testimony of both\nofficers, not just one, that they both smelled the odor of alcohol on Erickson’s\nbreath. See State v. Kennedy, 2014 WI 132, ¶¶22-23, 359 Wis. 2d 454, 856\nN.W.2d 834 (“an odor of intoxicants” among the facts that can support a finding\nof probable cause to arrest for a drunk-driving-related crime). Without providing\na citation to the record, Erickson refers to the smell of intoxicants on his breath\nreported by the officers as having been only a “light” smell. But the store manager\nand officers did not qualify the smell of intoxicants on Erickson’s breath as\n“light.” In fact, Officer Wedig testified that the odor was “[f]airly strong,” even\nwhen Erickson was standing outdoors in cold weather, an environment in which\nodor typically dissipates more readily than in a vehicle or a room of a structure.\n\n       ¶20    Slurred speech. Both officers testified that Erickson’s speech was\nslurred.   The circuit court found that Erickson’s speech featured “a mix of\nshortness of breath and slurring.” See id. (slurred speech among the relevant facts\nthat can support finding of probable cause to arrest for a drunk-driving-related\ncrime). At the same time, the court credited the testimony of the officers that\nErickson’s speech was not consistently slurred, only sometimes. This is also\nconsistent with Officer Wedig’s testimony that Erickson’s speech was generally\nnot difficult to understand.    But slurring of speech is one reasonably strong\nindication of potential impairment, and experience teaches that slurred speech by\nsome persons under some circumstances is not difficult to comprehend.\n\n       ¶21    Responses to questions. The circuit court found that, when Officer\nFlora asked Erickson if he had been drinking, Erickson “appeared to be evading\ngiving a direct response.”     For example, in Flora’s body camera recording,\nErickson can be heard denying that he had had anything to drink, despite the odor\nof alcohol on his breath. This counts toward meeting the probable-cause-to-\n\n                                          7\n\f                                                                         No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nbelieve standard. See State v. Babbitt, 188 Wis. 2d 349, 357, 525 N.W.2d 102 (Ct.\nApp. 1994) (fact that driver of stopped vehicle “consistently displayed an\nuncooperative attitude and reluctantly complied with the officers’ various\nrequests” contributed to conclusion that driver was probably driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol).\n\n       ¶22    Considered together, these facts were more than sufficient to justify\na request that Erickson submit to a PBT under WIS. STAT. § 343.303. That is,\nconsidering them “in the aggregate,” see State v. Hogan, 2015 WI 76, ¶37, 364\nWis. 2d 167, 868 N.W.2d 124, I conclude that any reasonable officer in the\nposition of these officers would reasonably suspect that Erickson had operated\nwith a prohibited alcohol concentration.\n\n       ¶23    Erickson argues that the circuit court erred in finding that his speech\nwas slurred and, when that finding is ignored, the cumulative evidence does not\nrise to the requisite level of probable cause. In support, Erickson contends that the\naudio from the officers’ body camera recordings provides objective evidence that\nErickson did not slur his words—rather, he was at times difficult to understand\nonly because he was out of breath from attempting to dig his car out of the snow\nusing an umbrella.\n\n       ¶24    Based on my own review of the recordings from both officers, I\ncannot conclude that it is unreasonable to interpret Erickson’s speech as both\nbeing affected by his being out of breath and also slurred at times. There may be\nother reasonable interpretations of Erickson’s speech, but this does not establish\nclear error. See State v. Sykes, 2005 WI 48, ¶21 n.7, 279 Wis. 2d 742, 695\nN.W.2d 277 (a factual finding is clearly erroneous if “‘it is against the great\nweight and clear preponderance of the evidence’” (quoted source omitted)).\n\n\n                                           8\n\f                                                                         No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nErickson faults the testimony of the officers, and the circuit court’s findings of\nfact, because specific slurred words were not identified.        But this does not\nestablish clear error in finding that Erickson slurred some words. In a similar vein,\nErickson emphasizes that, when cross examined about Erickson’s slurred speech,\nthe officers declined to characterize the slurring as “moderate[] or heav[y].” For\nexample, Officer Wedig testified that Erickson’s speech “was slurred. I don’t put\na level on it as far as moderate or not.” But Erickson does not explain why the\ncourt was obligated to discount the officers’ testimony regarding slurring merely\nbecause they did not characterize the degree of slurring.\n\n       ¶25    Still on the slurred speech topic, Erickson contends that the circuit\ncourt should not have credited the testimony of the officers in part because the\nofficers were unfamiliar with Erickson’s normal manner of talking. Erickson\nquestions how the officers could have determined that what sounded to the officers\nlike slurred words might not in fact have been attributable to Erickson’s normal\nspeech patterns, given that some people in their everyday speech slur their words\nmore than other people and that Erickson was a stranger to the officers. However,\nthis argument fails because police officers are not required to rule out innocent\ninferences when assessing whether there is probable cause to believe that a drunk-\ndriving-related offense has occurred. See State v. Nieves, 2007 WI App 189, ¶14,\n304 Wis. 2d 182, 738 N.W.2d 125 (“an officer is not required to draw a reasonable\ninference that favors innocence when there also is a reasonable inference that\nfavors probable cause”). Inebriation can cause slurred speech, even if slurred\nspeech can also arise from other causes.\n\n       ¶26    Erickson argues that the circuit court should have generally found\nthe officers to be not credible based on various statements that the officers made to\nErickson, but Erickson fails to show any credibility issue that could have arisen\n\n                                           9\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nfrom the statements that he highlights, much less an issue that undermines the\ncourt’s relevant findings. See State v. Hughes, 2000 WI 24, ¶2 n.1, 233 Wis. 2d\n280, 607 N.W.2d 621 (circuit court is the “‘ultimate arbiter of the credibility of a\nwitness’” and this court will uphold the circuit court’s “determination of\ncredibility unless that determination goes against the great weight and clear\npreponderance of the evidence” (quoted source omitted)). Erickson notes that\nOfficer Flora told Erickson that, if the officers determined that Erickson had “been\ndrinking,” then the officers were not going to allow him to “drive away,” and also\nnotes that later both officers told Erickson that, if the PBT reflected that he was\nbelow the legal limit, they would allow him to drive away. These statements can\nbe easily reconciled. In the first statement, the reference to “drinking” could\nreasonably be interpreted to mean consuming enough alcohol to put Erickson over\nthe legal limit, and consistent with that, a favorable PBT reading would put him in\nthe clear.4\n\n        ¶27     Erickson accurately observes that the officers here did not observe\nhim to have bloodshot or glassy eyes, nor did the officers observe him to display\n\n\n\n\n        4\n           For the first time in his reply brief on appeal, Erickson makes another argument based\non the officers’ statements about the possibility of Erickson avoiding detention, characterizing the\nofficers’ statements as a “ploy” or a “ruse.” The first problem with this argument is that it comes\ntoo late. See A.O. Smith Corp. v. Allstate Ins. Cos., 222 Wis. 2d 475, 492, 588 N.W.2d 285 (Ct.\nApp. 1998) (appellate courts generally do not consider arguments raised for the first time in an\nappellant’s reply brief for reasons of fundamental fairness). Further, the argument is not well\ndeveloped or supported. For example, Erickson fails to develop an argument that the circuit court\ncould not reach a contrary interpretation of the officers’ words and actions or an argument that,\nbased on these statements, the court was required to disregard other relevant aspects of the\nofficers’ testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                                10\n\f                                                                                No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\ndifficulty with his balance. But this additional evidence was not necessary to\nestablish the requisite level of probable cause.5\n\n        II. Probable Cause to Arrest\n\n        ¶28    Erickson argues that the circuit court should have suppressed\nevidence that police obtained after the moment when, in his view, he was arrested.\nSpecifically, he contends that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him\nwhen they placed him in handcuffs, at which time one of the officers told Erickson\nthat it was “too late” to provide a PBT. For purposes of this appeal, the City\nassumes that Erickson was arrested when the officers placed him in handcuffs, and\nI follow in that assumption. Taking that as the moment of arrest, I conclude that\nthe City has shown that the officers had probable cause to arrest Erickson at that\ntime.\n\n        ¶29    Our supreme court has explained the probable cause standard in this\ncontext as follows:\n\n               Probable cause to arrest for operating while under the\n               influence of an intoxicant refers to that quantum of\n               evidence within the arresting officer’s knowledge at the\n               time of the arrest that would lead a reasonable law\n               enforcement officer to believe that the defendant was\n               operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an\n               intoxicant. The burden is on the state to show that the\n               officer had probable cause to arrest\n\n                      The question of probable cause must be assessed on\n               a case-by-case basis, looking at the totality of the\n               circumstances. Probable cause is a “flexible, common-\n\n        5\n         Because I conclude that Officer Flora had probable cause to believe that Erickson had\ncommitted a drunk driving offense justifying the PBT request, I do not address the City’s\narguments that Erickson “waived” his challenge to the PBT request and that the appropriate\nremedy for an improper PBT request in this case is not suppression.\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n                sense measure of the plausibility of particular conclusions\n                about human behavior.” …. In determining whether there\n                is probable cause, the court applies an objective standard,\n                considering the information available to the officer and the\n                officer’s training and experience.\n\nState v. Lange, 2009 WI 49, ¶¶19-20, 317 Wis. 2d 383, 766 N.W.2d 551\n(footnotes, containing citations, omitted).\n\n        ¶30     The following is additional relevant background reflected on Officer\nFlora’s body camera recording.\n\n        ¶31     Officer Flora asked Erickson to submit to a PBT, and Erickson\nappeared to consent. But then Erickson walked around his car to the driver’s door,\nopened it, and sat down in the driver’s seat. After handing Officer Flora his\ndriver’s license, Erickson reached for a large, clear plastic bottle that appeared to\ncontain water. As Erickson uncapped the bottle, Officer Flora instructed him not\nto drink from it.6 Erickson responded that he was thirsty and took a drink lasting\nseveral seconds. Erickson then picked up his cell phone from inside the car and\nbegan to use it, appearing to scroll through an application. The officers instructed\nErickson to stop looking through his phone and to “blow into the tube” for the\nPBT. Erickson appeared to put his phone away. Erickson then said that he was\nout of breath. The officers responded that his shortness of breath should not\nmatter for purposes of registering a result in the test. Erickson then apparently\nfailed to provide a sufficiently long and steady breath for the PBT to work.\n\n\n\n\n        6\n           At the motion hearing, Officer Flora testified that, although he assumed that the bottle\ncontained only water, he was concerned that, if it instead contained alcohol, then drinking it could\n“taint” a PBT sample.\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\f                                                                          No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶32     In the next iteration of efforts by the officers, Officer Wedig held the\ntube up to Erickson’s face so that Erickson could try again to provide a breath\nsample. Erickson then attempted to get out of the car. Wedig blocked him from\ngetting out of the car. Erickson complained that the officers were violating his\nrights, took his phone back out, and resumed scrolling through it. Wedig told\nErickson that, if he did not cooperate in giving a sufficient breath sample for the\nPBT, then the officers would ask him to perform field sobriety tests. Wedig\npredicted that Erickson would fail field sobriety tests if subjected to them, and that\nthis would lead to Erickson’s arrest for drunk driving. Erickson took the position\nthat the officers lacked evidence that he had driven on a public roadway, as\nopposed to the privately owned parking lot. Erickson asked who had called the\nofficers to the scene (despite the fact that the officers had already told him,\naccurately, that it was the store manager who had called police). Erickson also\nasked to speak with a sergeant. Wedig instructed Erickson to get out of the car,\nand the officers placed Erickson in handcuffs.\n\n       ¶33     The circuit court made relevant findings of fact that included the\nfollowing: Erickson attempted to retract his initial statement to the officers that he\nhad been driving; he exhibited an “inability to follow police officer commands not\nto drink a clear liquid”; he displayed “odd behavior in scrolling through his phone\nwhile avoiding to answer questions asked of him”; and he appeared nervous and\nshowed “confrontational mannerisms.”             These findings individually and\ncollectively reasonably support the inference of consciousness of guilt. When they\nare considered as part of the totality of the circumstances, along with the facts\nsummarized above supporting the PBT request, probable cause to arrest was easily\nestablished.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                                                                          No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶34    Erickson contrasts the facts here with those of Renz, in which, to\nrepeat, our supreme court determined that an officer had the required degree of\nprobable cause to request the defendant to submit to a PBT. Erickson contends\nthat the Renz facts were “far more suspicious” than the facts here, and\naccordingly, the officers here could not have had probable cause to arrest. In\nRenz, an officer conducting a traffic stop was aware of the following indicia of\ndrunk driving when the officer requested that Renz perform a PBT: the traffic stop\ntook place at 2:00 a.m.; a strong odor of intoxicants came from inside the\ndefendant’s car; the defendant admitted to having had three beers; the officer had\nthe defendant undergo field sobriety tests, each of which the defendant was able to\n“substantially complete,” but the officer observed clues of intoxication for some,\nalthough not all, of the tests. See Renz, 231 Wis. 2d at 296-99, 316-17. The\ndefendant’s speech was not slurred. See id. at 317. Erickson notes that the court\nin Renz referred to this collection of facts as “exactly the sort of situation in which\na PBT proves extremely useful in determining whether there is probable cause for\nan OWI arrest.” Id. From this, Erickson argues that Renz “effectively held” that\nthe facts in Renz were insufficient to establish probable cause to arrest, which, to\nrepeat, is a higher quantum of evidence than “probable cause to believe” needed\nfor a PBT.\n\n       ¶35    I question whether Erickson properly interprets Renz as establishing\nthat facts approximating the level of evidence of drunk driving in Renz cannot\nconstitute probable cause to arrest. But setting this point to the side, I am not\npersuaded that the facts in Renz are “more suspicious” than the facts found by the\ncircuit court here.   Regarding the court’s findings here regarding Erickson’s\n“evasive,” “odd,” and “confrontational” behavior, Erickson asserts that these\nfindings show only that Erickson was “obstinan[t] and refus[ed] to cooperate with\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                                                           No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nlaw enforcement,” which he suggests should not count in the analysis. I disagree.\nWhen considered in the totality of the circumstances, these findings reasonably\nsupport both the specific inference that Erickson was intentionally uncooperative\nin a manner that reflected a guilty state of mind and the general determination of\nprobable cause that Erickson had driven while intoxicated.\n\n       ¶36    My conclusion that there was probable cause to arrest Erickson\ndefeats the basis of his challenge to the refusal.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n       ¶37    For all of these reasons, the judgment of the circuit court reflecting\nthe conviction and the court’s ruling on the refusal is affirmed.\n\n       ¶38    No costs awarded on the cross-appeal.\n\n              By the Court.—Judgment affirmed.\n\n              This    opinion   will   not     be    published.

Erickson challenges the court’s denial of his motion to\nsuppress evidence. Erickson argues that there was not sufficient evidence to\njustify a request by police that he submit to a preliminary breath test (PBT) before\nhis arrest. Erickson also contends that there was not sufficient evidence to support\nprobable cause to arrest him. I reject these arguments and accordingly affirm.2\n\n                                      BACKGROUND\n\n        ¶2      City of Monona police cited Erickson with operating a motor vehicle\nwhile intoxicated in violation of WIS. STAT. § 346.63(1)(a) and operating with\nprohibited alcohol concentration in violation of § 346.63(1)(b). The police also\ngave Erickson a notice of intent to revoke his operating privileges for allegedly\nrefusing to submit to a chemical test of his breath after his arrest under\nWisconsin’s implied consent law. See WIS. STAT. § 343.305.\n\n\n\n\n        2\n            The City of Monona cross appeals, but I need not address the cross appeal. Explaining\nfurther, the City challenges the circuit court’s determination that Erickson was not guilty of\noperating under the influence of an intoxicant on the ground that there is “no evidence in the\nrecord to support a not guilty verdict.” The City states that its cross appeal is “protective,” by\nwhich it means that the cross appeal is intended to preserve an argument that, if Erickson is\nsuccessful in his appeal of the prohibited alcohol concentration conviction, the City should be\nallowed to pursue a judgment against Erickson for operating under the influence of an intoxicant\nand a corresponding sentence.

He appealed for a trial de novo in the circuit court.\n\n       ¶4     In circuit court, Erickson filed a motion to suppress evidence\nobtained as a result of what he alleged was an unlawful request that he undergo a\nPBT. In the alternative, he moved to suppress evidence later obtained following\nhis arrest on the ground that the arrest was unlawful.\n\n       ¶5     The circuit court held an evidentiary hearing on Erickson’s motion.\nIt was established that Erickson entered a retail store on the night of January 28,\n2020, and asked to borrow or purchase a shovel to dig his car out of some sort of\nsnow accumulation in a nearby parking lot. Store employees did not give him a\nshovel. A manager of the store testified that, based on observations of Erickson\nduring this encounter, the manager believed that Erickson was drunk, and the\nmanager called the police to report suspicion of an intoxicated driver.\n\n       ¶6     The two officers who were dispatched in response, Jared Wedig and\nLandon Flora, testified in pertinent part as follows. Wedig and Flora went to a\nparking lot near the store, where the officers encountered Erickson, who was by\nhimself. Erickson was attempting to use an umbrella to dig a car out of several\ninches of snow that had accumulated on that portion of the lot.\n\n       ¶7     Both officers smelled the odor of alcohol on Erickson’s breath,\nnoticed that his speech was slurred, and observed that Erickson had parked his car\nin an unplowed portion of the parking lot, which was well-lit, despite the fact that\na significant portion of the parking lot had been plowed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n        ¶8      The officers requested that Erickson undergo a PBT.                     Erickson\ninitially consented to do this, but he did not provide a breath sample sufficient to\ncreate a meaningful result. The officers continued to talk with Erickson for a time,\nand then placed him in handcuffs and moved him to the front of one of the\nofficers’ squad cars. This was because, according to Wedig, Erickson was “trying\n[to] play games or at least prolong the process” of determining whether Erickson\nwas impaired for purposes of operating a motor vehicle. The officers requested\nthat Erickson take the PBT again, but he declined. The officers then requested that\nErickson undergo field sobriety tests, which he also declined.\n\n        ¶9      Officers Wedig and Flora both recorded their interactions with\nErickson on body cameras. Portions of these recordings were played during the\nhearing and are preserved in the record on appeal.\n\n        ¶10     On July 26, 2023, the circuit court issued a written decision denying\nErickson’s motion. As part of its analysis, the court fully credited the testimony of\nthe store manager and the officers.\n\n        ¶11     The circuit court held a bench trial on the citations, which also\nserved as the refusal hearing.3 The store manager and the two police officers again\ntestified, with Officer Flora’s testimony now additionally covering events after\nErickson’s arrest. This included testimony that Flora read to Erickson from an\n“informing the accused” form, that Erickson refused to submit to a chemical test\nof his breath, and that Flora then obtained a warrant to test Erickson’s blood. A\nphlebotomist testified regarding a blood sample that she took from Erickson after\n\n        3\n          Erickson moved for a jury trial, which the circuit court denied in a ruling that Erickson\ndoes not challenge on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f                                                                        No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nhe was transported by police to an area hospital. Further, an employee of the state\ncrime laboratory testified regarding the testing of the blood sample, which\nreflected a blood alcohol concentration of .092 grams per 100 milliliters.\n\n       ¶12    The circuit court found Erickson not guilty of operating while under\nthe influence and guilty of operating with a prohibited alcohol concentration. The\ncourt further found that Erickson had refused, after his arrest, to submit to the\nrequested chemical test of his breath and that it was unreasonable for him to do so.\n\n       ¶13    Erickson appeals.\n\n                                  DISCUSSION\n\n       ¶14    As noted, Erickson argues that the officers lacked the necessary level\nof probable cause to request that he undergo a PBT, and he further argues in the\nalternative that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him. I apply the\nfollowing standards of review to both issues.\n\n       ¶15    This court will “uphold the trial court’s findings of fact unless they\nare clearly erroneous.

In support, Erickson contends that the\naudio from the officers’ body camera recordings provides objective evidence that\nErickson did not slur his words—rather, he was at times difficult to understand\nonly because he was out of breath from attempting to dig his car out of the snow\nusing an umbrella.\n\n       ¶24    Based on my own review of the recordings from both officers, I\ncannot conclude that it is unreasonable to interpret Erickson’s speech as both\nbeing affected by his being out of breath and also slurred at times. There may be\nother reasonable interpretations of Erickson’s speech, but this does not establish\nclear error. See State v.

But this does not\nestablish clear error in finding that Erickson slurred some words. In a similar vein,\nErickson emphasizes that, when cross examined about Erickson’s slurred speech,\nthe officers declined to characterize the slurring as “moderate[] or heav[y].” For\nexample, Officer Wedig testified that Erickson’s speech “was slurred. I don’t put\na level on it as far as moderate or not.” But Erickson does not explain why the\ncourt was obligated to discount the officers’ testimony regarding slurring merely\nbecause they did not characterize the degree of slurring.\n\n       ¶25    Still on the slurred speech topic, Erickson contends that the circuit\ncourt should not have credited the testimony of the officers in part because the\nofficers were unfamiliar with Erickson’s normal manner of talking. Erickson\nquestions how the officers could have determined that what sounded to the officers\nlike slurred words might not in fact have been attributable to Erickson’s normal\nspeech patterns, given that some people in their everyday speech slur their words\nmore than other people and that Erickson was a stranger to the officers. However,\nthis argument fails because police officers are not required to rule out innocent\ninferences when assessing whether there is probable cause to believe that a drunk-\ndriving-related offense has occurred.

These statements can\nbe easily reconciled. In the first statement, the reference to “drinking” could\nreasonably be interpreted to mean consuming enough alcohol to put Erickson over\nthe legal limit, and consistent with that, a favorable PBT reading would put him in\nthe clear.4\n\n        ¶27     Erickson accurately observes that the officers here did not observe\nhim to have bloodshot or glassy eyes, nor did the officers observe him to display\n\n\n\n\n        4\n           For the first time in his reply brief on appeal, Erickson makes another argument based\non the officers’ statements about the possibility of Erickson avoiding detention, characterizing the\nofficers’ statements as a “ploy” or a “ruse.” The first problem with this argument is that it comes\ntoo late.

But this additional evidence was not necessary to\nestablish the requisite level of probable cause.5\n\n        II. Probable Cause to Arrest\n\n        ¶28    Erickson argues that the circuit court should have suppressed\nevidence that police obtained after the moment when, in his view, he was arrested.\nSpecifically, he contends that the officers lacked probable cause to arrest him\nwhen they placed him in handcuffs, at which time one of the officers told Erickson\nthat it was “too late” to provide a PBT. For purposes of this appeal, the City\nassumes that Erickson was arrested when the officers placed him in handcuffs, and\nI follow in that assumption. Taking that as the moment of arrest, I conclude that\nthe City has shown that the officers had probable cause to arrest Erickson at that\ntime.\n\n        ¶29    Our supreme court has explained the probable cause standard in this\ncontext as follows:\n\n               Probable cause to arrest for operating while under the\n               influence of an intoxicant refers to that quantum of\n               evidence within the arresting officer’s knowledge at the\n               time of the arrest that would lead a reasonable law\n               enforcement officer to believe that the defendant was\n               operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of an\n               intoxicant. The burden is on the state to show that the\n               officer had probable cause to arrest\n\n                      The question of probable cause must be assessed on\n               a case-by-case basis, looking at the totality of the\n               circumstances. Probable cause is a “flexible, common-\n\n        5\n         Because I conclude that Officer Flora had probable cause to believe that Erickson had\ncommitted a drunk driving offense justifying the PBT request, I do not address the City’s\narguments that Erickson “waived” his challenge to the PBT request and that the appropriate\nremedy for an improper PBT request in this case is not suppression.\n\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f                                                                                     No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n                sense measure of the plausibility of particular conclusions\n                about human behavior.” …. In determining whether there\n                is probable cause, the court applies an objective standard,\n                considering the information available to the officer and the\n                officer’s training and experience.\n\nState v.

But then Erickson walked around his car to the driver’s door,\nopened it, and sat down in the driver’s seat. After handing Officer Flora his\ndriver’s license, Erickson reached for a large, clear plastic bottle that appeared to\ncontain water. As Erickson uncapped the bottle, Officer Flora instructed him not\nto drink from it.6 Erickson responded that he was thirsty and took a drink lasting\nseveral seconds. Erickson then picked up his cell phone from inside the car and\nbegan to use it, appearing to scroll through an application. The officers instructed\nErickson to stop looking through his phone and to “blow into the tube” for the\nPBT. Erickson appeared to put his phone away. Erickson then said that he was\nout of breath. The officers responded that his shortness of breath should not\nmatter for purposes of registering a result in the test. Erickson then apparently\nfailed to provide a sufficiently long and steady breath for the PBT to work.\n\n\n\n\n        6\n           At the motion hearing, Officer Flora testified that, although he assumed that the bottle\ncontained only water, he was concerned that, if it instead contained alcohol, then drinking it could\n“taint” a PBT sample.\n\n\n\n\n                                                12\n\f                                                                          No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶32     In the next iteration of efforts by the officers, Officer Wedig held the\ntube up to Erickson’s face so that Erickson could try again to provide a breath\nsample. Erickson then attempted to get out of the car. Wedig blocked him from\ngetting out of the car. Erickson complained that the officers were violating his\nrights, took his phone back out, and resumed scrolling through it. Wedig told\nErickson that, if he did not cooperate in giving a sufficient breath sample for the\nPBT, then the officers would ask him to perform field sobriety tests. Wedig\npredicted that Erickson would fail field sobriety tests if subjected to them, and that\nthis would lead to Erickson’s arrest for drunk driving. Erickson took the position\nthat the officers lacked evidence that he had driven on a public roadway, as\nopposed to the privately owned parking lot. Erickson asked who had called the\nofficers to the scene (despite the fact that the officers had already told him,\naccurately, that it was the store manager who had called police). Erickson also\nasked to speak with a sergeant. Wedig instructed Erickson to get out of the car,\nand the officers placed Erickson in handcuffs.\n\n       ¶33     The circuit court made relevant findings of fact that included the\nfollowing: Erickson attempted to retract his initial statement to the officers that he\nhad been driving; he exhibited an “inability to follow police officer commands not\nto drink a clear liquid”; he displayed “odd behavior in scrolling through his phone\nwhile avoiding to answer questions asked of him”; and he appeared nervous and\nshowed “confrontational mannerisms.”             These findings individually and\ncollectively reasonably support the inference of consciousness of guilt. When they\nare considered as part of the totality of the circumstances, along with the facts\nsummarized above supporting the PBT request, probable cause to arrest was easily\nestablished.\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\f                                                                          No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\n       ¶34    Erickson contrasts the facts here with those of Renz, in which, to\nrepeat, our supreme court determined that an officer had the required degree of\nprobable cause to request the defendant to submit to a PBT. Erickson contends\nthat the Renz facts were “far more suspicious” than the facts here, and\naccordingly, the officers here could not have had probable cause to arrest. In\nRenz, an officer conducting a traffic stop was aware of the following indicia of\ndrunk driving when the officer requested that Renz perform a PBT: the traffic stop\ntook place at 2:00 a.m.; a strong odor of intoxicants came from inside the\ndefendant’s car; the defendant admitted to having had three beers; the officer had\nthe defendant undergo field sobriety tests, each of which the defendant was able to\n“substantially complete,” but the officer observed clues of intoxication for some,\nalthough not all, of the tests.

But setting this point to the side, I am not\npersuaded that the facts in Renz are “more suspicious” than the facts found by the\ncircuit court here.   Regarding the court’s findings here regarding Erickson’s\n“evasive,” “odd,” and “confrontational” behavior, Erickson asserts that these\nfindings show only that Erickson was “obstinan[t] and refus[ed] to cooperate with\n\n\n                                          14\n\f                                                                           No. 2024AP312\n\n\n\n\nlaw enforcement,” which he suggests should not count in the analysis. I disagree.\nWhen considered in the totality of the circumstances, these findings reasonably\nsupport both the specific inference that Erickson was intentionally uncooperative\nin a manner that reflected a guilty state of mind and the general determination of\nprobable cause that Erickson had driven while intoxicated.\n\n       ¶36    My conclusion that there was probable cause to arrest Erickson\ndefeats the basis of his challenge to the refusal.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n       ¶37    For all of these reasons, the judgment of the circuit court reflecting\nthe conviction and the court’s ruling on the refusal is affirmed.\n\n       ¶38    No costs awarded on the cross-appeal.\n\n              By the Court.—Judgment affirmed.\n\n              This    opinion   will   not     be    published.

          "syllabus": "This court recognized in State v. Colton (234 Conn. 683) that, in accordance with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Oregon v. Kennedy (456 U.S. 667), and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in United States v. Wallach (979 F.2d 912), the double jeopardy clause of the federal constitution bars a retrial if the prosecutor had engaged in impropriety with the intent to prevent an acquittal that the prosecutor believed was imminent in the absence of the impropriety. The defendant filed an interlocutory appeal with this court from the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss the murder charge against him. The defendant previously had been convicted of, among other crimes, murder, but this court reversed his murder conviction and ordered a new trial on the ground that the prosecutor, during the defendant's earlier criminal trial, had improperly commented on the defendant's silence occurring after he had been informed of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona (384 U.S. 436), in violation of Doyle v. Ohio (426 U.S. 610). On appeal from the denial of the motion to dismiss, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that double jeopardy protections barred a retrial on the murder charge insofar as the prosecutor, in commenting on the defendant's post-Miranda silence, had intended to prevent an acquittal that the prosecutor believed was imminent in the absence of the Doyle violation. Held: The trial court correctly determined that the defendant failed to establish that the prosecutor, in commenting on the defendant's post-Miranda silence, had intended to prevent an acquittal that the prosecutor believed was likely to occur but for the prosecutor's improper comments, and, accordingly, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. The defendant did not waive his double jeopardy claim by failing to move for a mistrial despite his awareness of the prosecutor's Doyle violation, as defense counsel moved for a new trial after the jury verdict on the ground that that prosecutor had violated the defendant's rights under Doyle, and the fact that the defense moved for a new trial rather than a mistrial did not change the fact that the reason for doing so was because of a claimed constitutional violation by the prosecutor. In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of family violence, we decline to use the defendant's full name or to identify the victim or others through whom the victim's identity may be ascertained. See General Statutes § 54-86e. The defendant, in connection with his motion to dismiss, did not present any additional evidence regarding the prosecutor's intent during the defendant's criminal trial, this court previously had concluded that the evidence pre- sented at the defendant's trial was sufficient to sustain his murder conviction, and the transcripts of the prosecutor's cross-examination of the defendant and closing argument, when assessed objectively, revealed that the prosecu- tor was attempting to secure the defendant's conviction rather than to goad the defense into moving for a mistrial on the basis of the prosecutor's belief that an acquittal was likely to occur but for the Doyle violation. Moreover, this court declined the state's request to overrule Colton and declined the defendant's request to overrule State v. Michael J. (274 Conn. 321), in which the court concluded that the state constitution did not provide broader double jeopardy protections in this context. Argued January 31—officially released June 3, 2025"

The Petitioner filed a petition for post-conviction relief, claiming that he had received the ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and that his guilty pleas were not voluntary. After a hearing, the post-conviction court denied relief. On appeal, the Petitioner maintains that he received the ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to file essential motions, failed to investigate, and misrepresented his legal experience. He also argues that his guilty pleas were unknowingly and involuntarily entered. He further contends that the cumulative effect of his attorney's errors entitles him to relief. After review, we affirm the post-conviction court's judgment."

      "syllabus": "This court recognized in State v. Colton (234 Conn. 683) that, in accordance with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Oregon v. Kennedy (456 U.S. 667), and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' decision in United States v. Wallach (979 F.2d 912), the double jeopardy clause of the federal constitution bars a retrial if the prosecutor had engaged in impropriety with the intent to prevent an acquittal that the prosecutor believed was imminent in the absence of the impropriety. The defendant filed an interlocutory appeal with this court from the trial court's denial of his motion to dismiss the murder charge against him. The defendant previously had been convicted of, among other crimes, murder, but this court reversed his murder conviction and ordered a new trial on the ground that the prosecutor, during the defendant's earlier criminal trial, had improperly commented on the defendant's silence occurring after he had been informed of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona (384 U.S. 436), in violation of Doyle v. Ohio (426 U.S. 610). On appeal from the denial of the motion to dismiss, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that double jeopardy protections barred a retrial on the murder charge insofar as the prosecutor, in commenting on the defendant's post-Miranda silence, had intended to prevent an acquittal that the prosecutor believed was imminent in the absence of the Doyle violation. Held: The trial court correctly determined that the defendant failed to establish that the prosecutor, in commenting on the defendant's post-Miranda silence, had intended to prevent an acquittal that the prosecutor believed was likely to occur but for the prosecutor's improper comments, and, accordingly, the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to dismiss. The defendant did not waive his double jeopardy claim by failing to move for a mistrial despite his awareness of the prosecutor's Doyle violation, as defense counsel moved for a new trial after the jury verdict on the ground that that prosecutor had violated the defendant's rights under Doyle, and the fact that the defense moved for a new trial rather than a mistrial did not change the fact that the reason for doing so was because of a claimed constitutional violation by the prosecutor. In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of family violence, we decline to use the defendant's full name or to identify the victim or others through whom the victim's identity may be ascertained. See General Statutes § 54-86e. The defendant, in connection with his motion to dismiss, did not present any additional evidence regarding the prosecutor's intent during the defendant's criminal trial, this court previously had concluded that the evidence pre- sented at the defendant's trial was sufficient to sustain his murder conviction, and the transcripts of the prosecutor's cross-examination of the defendant and closing argument, when assessed objectively, revealed that the prosecu- tor was attempting to secure the defendant's conviction rather than to goad the defense into moving for a mistrial on the basis of the prosecutor's belief that an acquittal was likely to occur but for the Doyle violation. Moreover, this court declined the state's request to overrule Colton and declined the defendant's request to overrule State v. Michael J. (274 Conn. 321), in which the court concluded that the state constitution did not provide broader double jeopardy protections in this context. Argued January 31—officially released June 3, 2025"
